  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year, I&#8217;ll be taking part in JDRF&#8217;s Walk to Cure Diabetes, along with one-half million other walkers across the country, as we try to reach our goal of raising $90 million.</p>

<p>Type 1, or juvenile, diabetes, is a devastating disease that affects millions of people - a large and growing percentage of them children. One of them is my oldest daughter, Abby, who is three years old.</p>

<p>Since Abby&#8217;s diagnosis, she&#8217;s had her fingers pricked over 800 times already. She&#8217;s received more than 200 shots in her arms, legs, and tummy. Over the course of her life, she&#8217;ll continue to receive daily insulin injections and finger pricks. She must take insulin to stay alive. We must constantly monitor her glucose levels to ward off complications such as blindness, kidney failure, and stroke. Abby must maintain strict control of her diet every day (even on birthdays and holidays), check her blood sugar at least 6 times a day, and take insulin at least twice a day.</p>

<p>There is some good news, though. For the first time, scientists are predicting that we CAN expect to see a cure well within our lifetime! This is exactly what we&#8217;re wishing for, so we&#8217;ve formed a team called &#8220;Wishing With Abby,&#8221; and we&#8217;d love to have your help.</p>

<p>Please visit my Walk Web page if you would like to donate online or see how close I am to<br/>
reaching my personal goal:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to post a picture of my new work setup for awhile, but I wanted to wait until I finished getting setup over at 160 Shadyac Avenue. Just for fun, I thought I&#8217;d go VMWare Fusion crazy and boot up every virtual machine I&#8217;ve got - you&#8217;re actually looking at 7 OS&#8217;s booted concurrently between two machines. To the left I&#8217;ve got my 15&#8221; MacBook Pro (2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM) running Mac OS 10.4, Windows XP, and Ubuntu. To the right I&#8217;ve got my Mac Pro tower (2 x 2 GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon processors, 5 GB 66 MHz DDR2 FB-DIMM RAM) driving the dual 19&#8221; Dell LCD&#8217;s, running Mac OS 10.4, Windows XP, Ubuntu, and Solaris Express. Whew - that was a mouthful. Thanks to Matt Raible for <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/re_one_30_monitor_or">blogging</a> about the Griffin Technologies iCurve laptop stand - I picked up its successor, the Elevator, for my MacBook Pro. I&#8217;ve got pictures from my past desktops over the years - I need to dig them up and show the procession of developer technology here. It&#8217;s been quite a ride from my first system as a junior developer six plus years ago.</p>

<p>&#8230;.because we&#8217;ve been packing to move on top of all of our regular projects. St. Jude has nicely renovated a new building for us, so we developers are moving. This is where I&#8217;m headed on Monday:</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Vo63LRwAZbk/RsYMGBQ4WUI/AAAAAAAAAQE/jDsZtab8xBA/s1600-h/DSC_4433.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Vo63LRwAZbk/RsYMGBQ4WUI/AAAAAAAAAQE/jDsZtab8xBA/s400/DSC_4433.JPG" alt="" /></a>I&#8217;m both loving it and a little sad - I&#8217;ve been sitting in my desk for nearly my entire career as a software developer. I just know I&#8217;m going to park in the garage and come downstairs one morning to find my office gone. :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=719803">http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=719803</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>On July 27, 2007, STJUDE-SRM 1.0 was released.</p></blockquote>

<p>STJUDE-SRM is a laboratory management system designed to support shared resource facility (or core lab) activities. It was designed and developed by the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital.</p>

<p>Shared resources supported include DNA synthesis, Peptide synthesis, DNA sequencing, Functional Genomics (spotted microarray laboratory), and Affymetrix (commercial microarrays) laboratories. STJUDE-SRM was also designed so that it is sufficiently modular and scalable to support other laboratory activities as needed. It could conceivably support all facilities on a campus or at a research organization and provide a single portal for investigators to access these resources, retrieve data, receive invoices for services, and generate reports.</p>

<p>Currently available is a build of STJUDE-SRM which is certified for JBoss 4.2.0.GA running on J2SE 5.0. Builds for JBoss 4.0.5.GA and BEA Weblogic Server 8.1 are forthcoming.</p>

<p>STJUDE-SRM 1.0 can be downloaded here: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=197795">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=197795</a></p>

<p>Please report all bugs you find in the STJUDE-SRM bug tracker: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=197795&amp;atid=962898">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=197795&amp;atid=962898</a></p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=197795&amp;atid=962898"></a></p>

<p>This is a VERY satisfying announcement for me, as I have spent the better part of the last six years working on this project. I was so excited when I learned we would be releasing it to the open source community. Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I posted earlier on my desire to <a href="http://matt-stine.blogspot.com/2007/07/help-me-become-better-programmer.html">become a better programmer</a>. Well, I&#8217;ve since put together a plan of action for the next twelve months. I&#8217;ve based some of these goals on suggestions from The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas.</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn Groovy and Grails</li>
</ol>


<p>Andy and Dave suggest learning a new language every year. I had already informally started learning Groovy and Grails after JavaOne 2007. Since I already have a head start on this one, Groovy will be my language for the next year (I&#8217;m learning Grails mainly because of my web development background - it will provide me more opportunity to apply my Groovy knowledge). This should be an easy way to get started on the goal of a new language each year since my Java knowledge should transfer easily.</p>

<ol>
<li>Release HallKeeper v1.0 as part of #1</li>
</ol>


<p>Several years ago I started an open source project called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hallkeeper">HallKeeper</a>. HallKeeper is planned to be a web-based management system for university residence halls. Life got in the way of this project so it lay dormant for a few years. I&#8217;ve recently revived it as sort of a &#8220;lab&#8221; in which to learn Groovy and Grails, and hopefully have a little fun along the way.</p>

<ol>
<li>Read and LEARN the following books:</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>* The Definitive Guide to Grails - Rocher
* The Pragmatic Programmer - Hunt, Thomas
* Computer Algorithms: Introduction to Design &amp; Analysis - Baase, Van Gelder
* Concepts of Programming Languages: Sebesta
* Groovy in Action - Konig
</code></pre>

<p>When I say LEARN, I mean I don&#8217;t just want to do a cursory read of these. I want to really engage the concepts presented in each and apply them to my day-to-day work. I already have a head start reading the first two books. The third and fourth books are actually textbooks from my undergraduate education. I could really use a refresher on these concepts, and I think I&#8217;m a much more serious student now as a professional than I was when I was actually a student.</p>

<ol>
<li>Review two books for the JavaLobby/DZone book review team</li>
</ol>


<p>I joined this team several months ago and was actually assigned to review two books - again, life got in the way (if you have any small children, you&#8217;ll understand). Things have settled down a bit now and I&#8217;ve asked to rejoin. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to crank out some reviews this time and learn something in the process.</p>

<ol>
<li>Pass the Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 5.0 Exam</li>
</ol>


<p>I want to do this mainly to give myself an excuse to go back over the fundamentals of Java, as well as learn the new features that 5.0 brought to the table in detail (generics, annotations, etc.). I have still basically been living in a Java 1.4 world as I&#8217;d say roughly 85% of my daily work is on an application that is still bound to that JDK. So, passing this is mainly just a reason to study, and it is a nice edition to the resume as well.</p>

<ol>
<li>Write one Java/software development blog article per week</li>
</ol>


<p>This would be numero uno! I&#8217;ve always stressed about the frequency of my blog writing - I&#8217;ve felt compelled to write every single day, and I usually end up writing a one paragraph synopsis of some other guy&#8217;s blog entry. Not exactly something that will attract many readers. I&#8217;ll still post those on a more frequent basis as they keep the content flowing, but I also want to write at least one in-depth article per week to give people something to look forward to. One way I&#8217;ll do this is to blog about the books I&#8217;m reading. The Pragmatic Programmer provides challenges and/or exercises at the end of each chapter - great seeds for entries.</p>

<ol>
<li>Attend JavaOne 2008 or similar conference</li>
</ol>


<p>This one depends on the boss - hopefully I&#8217;ll get to travel again this year. I&#8217;d love to go back to JavaOne - I learned a lot, and big geek shows always motivate me to go back and introduce new technology to the group, as well as get more involved in the community. I always feel a surge in my professional development in the 2-3 month period following my attending a conference.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start a Memphis/Mid-South Area Java User Group</li>
</ol>


<p>We don&#8217;t have a JUG in this area and I really think that we could benefit from one. My company has a large number of Java developers, and I know that several others in the area, including FedEx and Autozone do as well. This would be a great way to get some of the good speakers from the conferences I&#8217;ve attended to speak locally, and it may even serve to get us on the map with some of the smaller shows like NFJS. Sun and others really seem to take an interest in supporting JUGS, so I look forward to see what happens. I&#8217;ve started a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/memphis-mid-south-jug">Google Group</a> for the newborn JUG, and I&#8217;ll be blogging more in the future about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Graeme Rocher, founder of the Grails project, answers five more misconceptions about Groovy/Grails vs. Ruby/Rails. I&#8217;ve grown to be quite fond of both of these languages/frameworks; however, given the amount of investment I&#8217;ve placed into learning and applying Spring and Hibernate to the applications I&#8217;ve developed over the past two years, I have to say that Grails just makes sense for me as the next step toward becoming more &#8220;dynamic&#8221; in my approach to development projects.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have decided to embark upon a quest to become a better programmer. I would really like to improve my understanding of the computer science that underlies my day-to-day tasks, particularly as it relates to programming language design as well as algorithm design and complexity analysis. I would also like to improve my analytical and problem solving skills. I&#8217;ve found that I&#8217;m really good at learning new technologies and quickly bringing them to bear on web application development problems, but take me out of that problem space and I get nervous rather quickly.</p>

<p>Who has ideas about the best way to go about this? Please comment!</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2007-06-27T12:54:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 27<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I was faced with the challenge of implementing form-level (or page-level) validation in a JSF-based application. What I mean by form-level validation is the need to evaluate a subset of a form&#8217;s fields as a unit, rather than simply validating each field in isolation. An example of this type of validation can be found on a user registration form where one has to select a password in one text field, and then retype the same password in another text field for confirmation. Validating that these two text fields contain the same password is an example of form level validation.</p>

<p>In my case, I had two date selector components on my form, one for a start date/time and one for an end date/time for an event that was being scheduled. The rule I needed to validate was that the end date/time was later than the start date/time.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to implement validation like this, including but not limited to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Build a custom component that renders selectors for both the start and end date/time, then validate as a unit. This actually is field-level validation and doesn&#8217;t truly address the form-level problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a validator method on a managed bean that will evaluate the data submitted for multiple components.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I&#8217;ll address the second method in this HOWTO.</p>

<p>First, you&#8217;ll need to bind at least <em>n-1</em> of the components that you want to validate to properties on your managed bean. The simplest way is to declare properties of type <strong>UIInput</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;private UIInput startDateComponent;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;public UIInput getStartDateComponent() {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;    return startDateComponent;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;public void setStartDateComponent(UIInput startDateComponent) {  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;    this.startDateComponent = startDateComponent;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

<p>and do the actual binding in the JSP:</p>

<blockquote><p><br></br>&lt;t:inputDate id=&#8221;eventStart&#8221; value=&#8221;#{orderForm.sampleInfo.requestedStartTime}&#8221;<br></br>    type=&#8221;both&#8221;<br></br>    popupCalendar=&#8221;true&#8221;<br></br>    ampm=&#8221;true&#8221; binding=&#8221;#{dateValidationForm.startDateComponent}&#8221;/><br></br></p></blockquote>

<p>Next, you&#8217;ll implement the validation method, which can have any name you like, but must share the same signature as this example:</p>

<blockquote><p><br></br>public void validateEndDate(FacesContext context, UIComponent toValidate, Object value) {<br></br>    Date endDate = (Date) value;<br></br>    Date startDate = (Date) getStartDateComponent().getLocalValue();<br></br><br></br>    if (startDate == null) {<br></br>        context.addMessage(getStartDateComponent().getClientId(context),new FacesMessage(&#8220;Please specify a valid date and time.&#8221;));<br></br>        throw new ValidatorException(new FacesMessage());<br></br>    }<br></br><br></br>    long endTime = endDate.getTime();<br></br>    long startTime = startDate.getTime();<br></br><br></br>    if (startTime >= endTime) {<br></br>        addError(&#8220;errors.batchOrder.invalidEndDate&#8221;);<br></br>        throw new ValidatorException(new FacesMessage(&#8220;Event end must be later than event start.&#8221;));<br></br>    }<br></br>}<br></br></p></blockquote>

<p>And finally, you&#8217;ll bind the validation method to the last component in your subset of components that need to be validated together:</p>

<blockquote><p><br></br>&lt;t:inputDate id=&#8221;eventEnd&#8221; value=&#8221;#{orderForm.sampleInfo.requestedEndTime}&#8221; type=&#8221;both&#8221; popupCalendar=&#8221;true&#8221; ampm=&#8221;true&#8221; validator=&#8221;#{dateValidationForm.validateEndDate}&#8221;/><br></br></blockquote></p>

<p>To understand why I say <em>n-1</em> components, think of the way the validation phase occurs in JSF. Data is bound to the components in the order that they occur in the JSF component tree, which just so happens to be the order in which they appear in the JSP source. Looking at the <strong>validateEndDate</strong> method, you&#8217;ll see that I only reference the <strong>startDateComponent</strong> from the binding, but I reference the <strong>endDate</strong> as the <strong>Object value</strong> reference that was passed into the method. This is why you only need to bind <em>n-1</em> components, because you get the <em>nth</em> component from the method signature.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you want to be more uniform and bind all of the components, you could create an extra dummy hidden value component and bind the validator method to it. You could then bind all of the components to your managed bean and access them all from the bindings rather than accessing one from the method signature.</p>

<p>The <strong>validateEndDate</strong> method itself is rather simple. First you access the data by getting the local value of each component (again, the <strong>endDate</strong> value is not accessed in this way - in fact, it hasn&#8217;t been bound yet because it must be validated first, and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening in this method!). You then apply the business rule. You&#8217;ll see that first I look to see if the <strong>startDate</strong> is null. I&#8217;m not sure why this is possible, but if the <strong>startDate</strong> was not submitting a good value on the FIRST submit, the local value was null. So, I catch that here. I add an error message to the <strong>startDateComponent</strong> and throw a <strong>ValidatorException</strong>. If the business rule is violated, throw a <strong>ValidatorException</strong>. (I&#8217;m also using the <strong>addError</strong> method provided by AppFuse to work w/ its message framework as well, but that is not necessary w/ all JSF apps).</p>

<p>Now, for the final problem I encountered. In Weblogic server, which we&#8217;re still using for the time being, if your session cannot be serialized then it deletes your entire session. Obviously this can cause major problems in any web app. To deal with this, ANY SESSION SCOPED MANAGED BEAN must be fully serializable, meaning it and any objects referenced in its state. Herein lies the problem for JSF. Instances of <strong>UIComponent</strong> (an ancestor of <strong>UIInput</strong>) are not serializable, so if we bind our components to <strong>UIInput</strong> fields on a session-scoped managed bean (the bean backing this form is an Order Form/Shopping Cart style bean), it will not be serializable and Weblogic will kick out your session.</p>

<p>To deal with this problem, realize that there is no reason that you can only have one managed bean backing a form. In fact, you can reference as many managed beans as you need. Since validation is done for each request, there is no need to manage any state there across multiple requests like we need to do with a shopping cart. So, why not declare an additional managed bean that is REQUEST SCOPED, and then put the bindings and validation method there. That is exactly what I did. Here is the entire bean:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><p><br></br>public class DateValidationForm extends BasePage {<br></br><br></br>    private UIInput startDateComponent;<br></br><br></br>    public UIInput getStartDateComponent() {<br></br>        return startDateComponent;<br></br>    }<br></br> <br></br>    public void setStartDateComponent(UIInput startDateComponent) {<br></br>        this.startDateComponent = startDateComponent;<br></br>    }<br></br><br></br>    public void validateEndDate(FacesContext context, UIComponent toValidate, Object value) {<br></br>        Date endDate = (Date) value;<br></br>        Date startDate = (Date) getStartDateComponent().getLocalValue();<br></br><br></br>        if (startDate == null) {<br></br>            context.addMessage(getStartDateComponent().getClientId(context),new FacesMessage(&#8220;Please specify a valid date and time.&#8221;));<br></br>            throw new ValidatorException(new FacesMessage());<br></br>        }<br></br><br></br>        long endTime = endDate.getTime();<br></br>        long startTime = startDate.getTime();<br></br><br></br>        if (startTime >= endTime) {<br></br>            addError(&#8220;errors.batchOrder.invalidEndDate&#8221;);<br></br>            throw new ValidatorException(new FacesMessage(&#8220;Event end must be later than event start.&#8221;));<br></br>        }<br></br>    }<br></br>}<br></br></p></blockquote>

<p>and the declaration in faces-config.xml:</p>

<blockquote><p><br></br><managed-bean><br></br>    <managed-bean-name>dateValidationForm</managed-bean-name><br></br>    <managed-bean-class>org.stjude.hc.srmcti.webapp.action.ordering.</p>

<pre><code>DateValidationForm&lt;/managed-bean-class&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;    &lt;managed-bean-scope&gt;request&lt;/managed-bean-scope&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/managed-bean&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>The added bonus is that you can reuse this bean across all forms where you need this behavior. My application happens to have 2 additional forms where I would have repeated this logic, so I just reference this bean there.</p></blockquote>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

It&#8217;s Friday night, and what am I doing but coding. My wife&#8217;s night out is spent at the scrapbook store working on her latest layouts - mine is at my new favorite coffee shop, working on open source. I discovered this place on a date with Wendy a couple of months ago. The nice thing about it is the distinctly Christian atmosphere. A good friend of mine and I meet here on Friday mornings for accountability. Well, since they hand out free wireless internet, I thought I&#8217;d drop by for my night out as well. Good coding atmosphere - I have a nice corner with a plugin for my laptop, so I&#8217;m good to go. Check this place out if you&#8217;re in DeSoto County, MS or the Memphis metro area anytime soon - <a href="http://grovecoffeehouse.com">http://grovecoffeehouse.com</a>.</p>
