  <div class="entry-content"><p>Greetings from <a href="http://www.thespringexperience.com">The Spring Experience 2007</a> in Hollywood, FL. So far this has been a great conference - I&#8217;m currently waiting for my third session of the day to start. As much as I enjoy all of the hype and eye candy at JavaOne, I really get a lot more out of these smaller conferences as you&#8217;re not running around stressed out trying to weave through thousands of geeks as you move from session to session (or more accurately, from session to queue!).</p>

<p>I wanted to post a few insights that I gained from Rod Johnson&#8217;s keynote last night (the title of this entry). The basis for Rod&#8217;s presentation was a Gartner report entitled &#8221;<a href="http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?ref=g_search&amp;id=525420&amp;subref=simplesearch">Trends in Platform Middleware: Disruption Is in Sight</a>.&#8221; To summarize, there are many converging forces in the enterprise Java space that are causing or will probably cause a great deal of disruption in the way we develop enterprise Java applications. These forces include our collective experience with application servers, the rediscovery of object-oriented or POJO-based programming, open source innovation, non-Java challengers (.NET, RoR), the rise of SOA, and Rich Internet Applications. Rod sees a big movement from the &#8220;old guard,&#8221; which he described as the &#8220;J2EE Stovepipe Architecture&#8221; which was based primarily around the idea of distributed objects, to a world in which many of the highest volume Java applications don&#8217;t even use a Java EE application server. An interesting point was the stagnation in job requirements for the big name application servers coupled with the BZ Research statistic that 64% of Java application developers are using Tomcat for production deployment. Yet another force for disruption is the emergence of OSGi, which allows developers to modularize applications and provides facilities for versioned components, fine-grained redeployment, and library conflict resolution - all features that Java EE currently does not and perhaps cannot address. Open source provides yet more disruption, as developers have become participants in rather than spectators of the development of Java enterprise solutions. Innovation is now primarily coming from the open source world. All of this culminated in the rather telegraphed conclusion that Rod (and also the Gartner report apparently) believes that Spring is uniquely positioned to provide the best value for ongoing Enterprise Java development in the face of the current trends. Of course, what would you expect him to say? :-) <a href="http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?ref=g_search&amp;id=525420&amp;subref=simplesearch"><br/>
</a><br/>
I do tend to agree with him. The pace at which Spring is innovating and addressing the Java enterprise pain points far outpaces the pace of the JCP. It just takes too long to design specs by committee. One of the more wise things that Spring does is to learn from and in most cases accommodate the changing landscape of Java EE and integrate the best features directly into the framework. I for one am glad to be developing applications with Spring, as it makes it very easy to do the things I want to do and write quality code that isn&#8217;t directly dependent on an infrastructure framework. Generally, it stays out of my way.</p>

<p>More to come on the sessions I&#8217;ve attended thus far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year, I&#8217;ll be taking part in JDRF&#8217;s Walk to Cure Diabetes, along with one-half million other walkers across the country, as we try to reach our goal of raising $90 million.</p>

<p>Type 1, or juvenile, diabetes, is a devastating disease that affects millions of people - a large and growing percentage of them children. One of them is my oldest daughter, Abby, who is three years old.</p>

<p>Since Abby&#8217;s diagnosis, she&#8217;s had her fingers pricked over 800 times already. She&#8217;s received more than 200 shots in her arms, legs, and tummy. Over the course of her life, she&#8217;ll continue to receive daily insulin injections and finger pricks. She must take insulin to stay alive. We must constantly monitor her glucose levels to ward off complications such as blindness, kidney failure, and stroke. Abby must maintain strict control of her diet every day (even on birthdays and holidays), check her blood sugar at least 6 times a day, and take insulin at least twice a day.</p>

<p>There is some good news, though. For the first time, scientists are predicting that we CAN expect to see a cure well within our lifetime! This is exactly what we&#8217;re wishing for, so we&#8217;ve formed a team called &#8220;Wishing With Abby,&#8221; and we&#8217;d love to have your help.</p>

<p>Please visit my Walk Web page if you would like to donate online or see how close I am to<br/>
reaching my personal goal:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to post a picture of my new work setup for awhile, but I wanted to wait until I finished getting setup over at 160 Shadyac Avenue. Just for fun, I thought I&#8217;d go VMWare Fusion crazy and boot up every virtual machine I&#8217;ve got - you&#8217;re actually looking at 7 OS&#8217;s booted concurrently between two machines. To the left I&#8217;ve got my 15&#8221; MacBook Pro (2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM) running Mac OS 10.4, Windows XP, and Ubuntu. To the right I&#8217;ve got my Mac Pro tower (2 x 2 GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon processors, 5 GB 66 MHz DDR2 FB-DIMM RAM) driving the dual 19&#8221; Dell LCD&#8217;s, running Mac OS 10.4, Windows XP, Ubuntu, and Solaris Express. Whew - that was a mouthful. Thanks to Matt Raible for <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/re_one_30_monitor_or">blogging</a> about the Griffin Technologies iCurve laptop stand - I picked up its successor, the Elevator, for my MacBook Pro. I&#8217;ve got pictures from my past desktops over the years - I need to dig them up and show the procession of developer technology here. It&#8217;s been quite a ride from my first system as a junior developer six plus years ago.</p>

<p>&#8230;.because we&#8217;ve been packing to move on top of all of our regular projects. St. Jude has nicely renovated a new building for us, so we developers are moving. This is where I&#8217;m headed on Monday:</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Vo63LRwAZbk/RsYMGBQ4WUI/AAAAAAAAAQE/jDsZtab8xBA/s1600-h/DSC_4433.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Vo63LRwAZbk/RsYMGBQ4WUI/AAAAAAAAAQE/jDsZtab8xBA/s400/DSC_4433.JPG" alt="" /></a>I&#8217;m both loving it and a little sad - I&#8217;ve been sitting in my desk for nearly my entire career as a software developer. I just know I&#8217;m going to park in the garage and come downstairs one morning to find my office gone. :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=719803">http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=719803</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>On July 27, 2007, STJUDE-SRM 1.0 was released.</p></blockquote>

<p>STJUDE-SRM is a laboratory management system designed to support shared resource facility (or core lab) activities. It was designed and developed by the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital.</p>

<p>Shared resources supported include DNA synthesis, Peptide synthesis, DNA sequencing, Functional Genomics (spotted microarray laboratory), and Affymetrix (commercial microarrays) laboratories. STJUDE-SRM was also designed so that it is sufficiently modular and scalable to support other laboratory activities as needed. It could conceivably support all facilities on a campus or at a research organization and provide a single portal for investigators to access these resources, retrieve data, receive invoices for services, and generate reports.</p>

<p>Currently available is a build of STJUDE-SRM which is certified for JBoss 4.2.0.GA running on J2SE 5.0. Builds for JBoss 4.0.5.GA and BEA Weblogic Server 8.1 are forthcoming.</p>

<p>STJUDE-SRM 1.0 can be downloaded here: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=197795">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=197795</a></p>

<p>Please report all bugs you find in the STJUDE-SRM bug tracker: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=197795&amp;atid=962898">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=197795&amp;atid=962898</a></p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=197795&amp;atid=962898"></a></p>

<p>This is a VERY satisfying announcement for me, as I have spent the better part of the last six years working on this project. I was so excited when I learned we would be releasing it to the open source community. Enjoy!</p>

<p>For more information on STJUDE-SRM, please visit: <a href="http://stjude-srm.sourceforge.net">http://stjude-srm.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I posted earlier on my desire to <a href="http://matt-stine.blogspot.com/2007/07/help-me-become-better-programmer.html">become a better programmer</a>. Well, I&#8217;ve since put together a plan of action for the next twelve months. I&#8217;ve based some of these goals on suggestions from The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas.</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn Groovy and Grails</li>
</ol>


<p>Andy and Dave suggest learning a new language every year. I had already informally started learning Groovy and Grails after JavaOne 2007. Since I already have a head start on this one, Groovy will be my language for the next year (I&#8217;m learning Grails mainly because of my web development background - it will provide me more opportunity to apply my Groovy knowledge). This should be an easy way to get started on the goal of a new language each year since my Java knowledge should transfer easily.</p>

<ol>
<li>Release HallKeeper v1.0 as part of #1</li>
</ol>


<p>Several years ago I started an open source project called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hallkeeper">HallKeeper</a>. HallKeeper is planned to be a web-based management system for university residence halls. Life got in the way of this project so it lay dormant for a few years. I&#8217;ve recently revived it as sort of a &#8220;lab&#8221; in which to learn Groovy and Grails, and hopefully have a little fun along the way.</p>

<ol>
<li>Read and LEARN the following books:</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>* The Definitive Guide to Grails - Rocher
* The Pragmatic Programmer - Hunt, Thomas
* Computer Algorithms: Introduction to Design &amp; Analysis - Baase, Van Gelder
* Concepts of Programming Languages: Sebesta
* Groovy in Action - Konig
</code></pre>

<p>When I say LEARN, I mean I don&#8217;t just want to do a cursory read of these. I want to really engage the concepts presented in each and apply them to my day-to-day work. I already have a head start reading the first two books. The third and fourth books are actually textbooks from my undergraduate education. I could really use a refresher on these concepts, and I think I&#8217;m a much more serious student now as a professional than I was when I was actually a student.</p>

<ol>
<li>Review two books for the JavaLobby/DZone book review team</li>
</ol>


<p>I joined this team several months ago and was actually assigned to review two books - again, life got in the way (if you have any small children, you&#8217;ll understand). Things have settled down a bit now and I&#8217;ve asked to rejoin. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to crank out some reviews this time and learn something in the process.</p>

<ol>
<li>Pass the Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 5.0 Exam</li>
</ol>


<p>I want to do this mainly to give myself an excuse to go back over the fundamentals of Java, as well as learn the new features that 5.0 brought to the table in detail (generics, annotations, etc.). I have still basically been living in a Java 1.4 world as I&#8217;d say roughly 85% of my daily work is on an application that is still bound to that JDK. So, passing this is mainly just a reason to study, and it is a nice edition to the resume as well.</p>

<ol>
<li>Write one Java/software development blog article per week</li>
</ol>


<p>This would be numero uno! I&#8217;ve always stressed about the frequency of my blog writing - I&#8217;ve felt compelled to write every single day, and I usually end up writing a one paragraph synopsis of some other guy&#8217;s blog entry. Not exactly something that will attract many readers. I&#8217;ll still post those on a more frequent basis as they keep the content flowing, but I also want to write at least one in-depth article per week to give people something to look forward to. One way I&#8217;ll do this is to blog about the books I&#8217;m reading. The Pragmatic Programmer provides challenges and/or exercises at the end of each chapter - great seeds for entries.</p>

<ol>
<li>Attend JavaOne 2008 or similar conference</li>
</ol>


<p>This one depends on the boss - hopefully I&#8217;ll get to travel again this year. I&#8217;d love to go back to JavaOne - I learned a lot, and big geek shows always motivate me to go back and introduce new technology to the group, as well as get more involved in the community. I always feel a surge in my professional development in the 2-3 month period following my attending a conference.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start a Memphis/Mid-South Area Java User Group</li>
</ol>


<p>We don&#8217;t have a JUG in this area and I really think that we could benefit from one. My company has a large number of Java developers, and I know that several others in the area, including FedEx and Autozone do as well. This would be a great way to get some of the good speakers from the conferences I&#8217;ve attended to speak locally, and it may even serve to get us on the map with some of the smaller shows like NFJS. Sun and others really seem to take an interest in supporting JUGS, so I look forward to see what happens. I&#8217;ve started a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/memphis-mid-south-jug">Google Group</a> for the newborn JUG, and I&#8217;ll be blogging more in the future about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Graeme Rocher, founder of the Grails project, answers five more misconceptions about Groovy/Grails vs. Ruby/Rails. I&#8217;ve grown to be quite fond of both of these languages/frameworks; however, given the amount of investment I&#8217;ve placed into learning and applying Spring and Hibernate to the applications I&#8217;ve developed over the past two years, I have to say that Grails just makes sense for me as the next step toward becoming more &#8220;dynamic&#8221; in my approach to development projects.</p>
