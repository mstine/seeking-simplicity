  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2695/522/1600/Adrian_Rogers2.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2695/522/320/Adrian_Rogers2.jpg" alt="" /></a><br/>
This morning, Dr. Adrian Rogers walked into glory. Dr. Rogers was my first pastor. I never had the opportunity to share this with him, but he is ultimately the man who led me to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. I experienced false conversion as a child, was never baptized, and never experienced the true change of heart that comes from the new birth. Shortly after our marriage, my wife and I joined Bellevue Baptist Church, where I was then baptized. I realized that I knew very little about the foundations of my faith, so when I learned that Dr. Rogers taught a course on Wednesday nights called &#8220;Back to the Basics: What Every Christian Ought to Know,&#8221; I quickly signed up. It was the second or third week of the class when Dr. Rogers spoke on the subject, &#8220;How to Be Saved and Know It.&#8221; During this class Dr. Rogers revealed that as a young man he had struggled with doubting his salvation.</p>

<p>Quoting from <a href="http://www.bellevue.org/templates/cusbellevue1103/details.asp?id=1360&amp;PID=33044&amp;mast=">this message</a>, Adrian Rogers said, &#8220;One night I looked up into the heavens and said, &#8216;God, I&#8217;ve got to have assurance. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m lost and the Holy Spirit has me under conviction, or I&#8217;m saved and the devil is trying to get me to doubt my salvation. But one thing I know: You said if I would believe on You, You would save me. So, Lord, right now, I trust You to save me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I went home that evening and prayed that very prayer, and the rest is spiritual history. Though I didn&#8217;t become instantly perfect (and I&#8217;m still quite far away from perfection), I finally experienced that change of heart and life that comes from salvation. I&#8217;ve since been baptized again (to get it in the right order), as after the self-examination commanded by <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013:5;&amp;version=31;">2 Corinthians 13:5</a> I realized that that night was when I was truly saved.   So, to Heaven I send a heartfelt thank you to Dr. Adrian Rogers, and I look forward to seeing him again one day.</p>

<p>Besides him leading me to Christ, if that wasn&#8217;t enough, I&#8217;ve learned a great deal from Dr. Rogers about what it means to be a man of God and a great husband and father. He&#8217;s taught me from the pulpit, from books, and from personal example. He truly was, and still is, a good and faithful servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It appears that Ruby on Rails is changing the WORLD of software development - I wasn&#8217;t aware of just how much influence it was having in the world of other languages. Here Marc Fleury (JBoss CEO) says that it had a huge influence on Seam - JBoss&#8217;s venture into the Java web framework space. And then the list of RoR clones: Biscuit (PHP), Grails (Java), Monorail (.NET), Turbo Gears (Python), Cake PHP, Subway (Python), Catalyst (Perl)&#8230;..All I can say is that the RoR guys must have done something right!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Ruby on Rails hype continues - Bruce Tate considers the possibility that it may be &#8220;the next big thing,&#8221; as well as letting us know that &#8220;It&#8217;s time to start paying attention again. It&#8217;s time to look at the horizon, beyond Java.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve been thinking about this issue a lot lately - I mean, even 10 years ago none of us could have predicted that we&#8217;d be using Java as much and in the way we are now.  It was a C/C++ world.  Now we don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;d do without Java - or do we.  Scripting languages seem to have the momentum right now - even in the Javaspace (see Groovy).  Ruby on Rails, as much as I&#8217;ve seen of it, is EXTREMELY impressive.  If we can repeatedly solve the BIG problems in a scalable, maintainable way with these languages, plus we get the added benefits of dynamic typing, etc., why wouldn&#8217;t we transition?  I&#8217;m excited to check this book out, and also excited to be in the web development space right now.  Who knows - 10 years from now we might be looking at &#8220;Beyond Rails.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Spurgeon&#8217;s evening devotional for today packs a punch.  I can&#8217;t get over the last few sentences:</p>

<p>O professor, too little separated from sinners, you know not what you lose by your conformity to the world. It cuts the tendons of your strength, and makes you creep where you ought to run. Then, for your own comfort&#8217;s sake, and for the sake of your growth in grace, if you be a Christian, be a Christian, and be a marked and distinct one. __</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bill O&#8217;Reilly slams the ACLU for being what it is - not a defender of Constitutional rights, but a militant organization fighting for its own radical, secular, progressive agenda. BO states:</p>

<p>&#8220;The ACLU simply wants a different country, a nation where conduct it approves of, public sexual displays, child molestation literature is allowed. But the ACLU wants to inhibit conduct it disagrees with, like protesting the border and celebrating the birth of Jesus. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/10/13/what_is_rails.html">What Is Ruby on Rails</a> by Curt Hibbs &#8211; Ruby on Rails is an impressive web development framework that will soon reach version 1.0. While there&#8217;s a lot of buzz, it can sometimes be difficult to discern the steak beneath the sizzle. Curt Hibbs walks through the features and pieces of Ruby on Rails to show how it fits together and where its big benefits come from.</p>

<p>I read this article this morning and I have to say it makes me even more impressed with Rails. I think it has the potential to be a BIG player in the web application development space - if not to replace Java, PHP, etc., with Ruby as many developers&#8217; platform of choice, it will definitely challenge the existing framework developers for Java, etc., to scale even bigger heights when it comes to features and ease of development.</p>
