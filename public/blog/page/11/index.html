  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found <a href="http://blogs.opensymphony.com/plightbo/2006/08/project_able_a_complete_java_w.html">Project Able</a> while reading <a href="http://www.analienandastranger.com/?p=25">Raible’s blog</a> this morning. While it doesn’t claim to duplicate everything that AppFuse does (i.e. they pick a framework and stick with it instead of providing choice), they are doing some neat things. I may take a look at it if I ever have time. <img src="http://www.analienandastranger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<blockquote><p>Project Able is a full Java-based web development stack designed to make web development painless. In a sense, it is an attempt to bring together quality opensource tools in one cohesive stack, similar to what Rails has done for Ruby, while also encouraging common practices I’ve used in software engineering for a long time.</p>

<p>It is very similar to projects such as Trails, Grails, and AppFuse. However, there are a few key differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>The stack components are different (WebWork, Spring, iBatis, etc).</li>
<li>In addition to the basic framework, Able also encourages common development techniques and patterns (more below).</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve wanted for some time now to write a blog entry promoting my favorite open source project - AppFuse. Since I started developing web applications using AppFuse as a base, I can truly say that I’ve rediscovered the joy of software development. I’ve found no other technology or methodology that has allowed me to place as much focus as I now do on solving business problems and not on technology ramp-up or figuring out the eccentricities of “framework X.” In this article, <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/">Matt Raible</a>, the founder of the <a href="http://www.appfuse.org/">AppFuse</a> project, humbly states very compelling reasons that you should use AppFuse for your J2EE development. To summarize, here are the 7 reaons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Integration</li>
<li>Automation</li>
<li>Security Features and Extensibility</li>
<li>Code Generation with AppGen</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Community</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently finished integrating <a href="http://http//www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a> with AppFuse for a project I&#8217;m working on. JFreeChart is a really powerful Java chart library. If your application has any requirements for charts/graphs, I highly recommend it. The user manual and demo code come with a price tag ($39.95 for a single developer), but they are well worth the purchase - especially the demo code. If you don&#8217;t have the $$$, the <a href="http://www.jfree.org/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=3">support forum</a> is also very helpful.</p>

<p>I plan to put together a tutorial to help anyone interested in using JFreeChart in their AppFuse application. Look for it here and on the appfuse-user mailing list. It will be based on JSF since that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m using right now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently Matt Raible thought my JSF modifications to the AppFuse-Compass tutorial were good enough to merit a mention on his blog: <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/page/rd?entry=appfuse_videos_updated_for_1">AppFuse Videos updated for 1.9.3</a>.  Check out the bottom of the entry.</p>

<p>Compass really is a nice tool - I was able to provide search capabilities for an app I&#8217;m working on right now with about 2 days worth of work (having never worked w/ Compass before), and man is it fast! I can&#8217;t get a search to exceed 1.5 seconds!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found an interesting article this morning by way of <a href="http://digg.com/programming">Digg.com Programming</a>: <a href="http://sztywny.titaniumhosting.com/2006/07/23/stiff-asks-great-programmers-answers/">Stiff asks, great programmers answer</a>. The author posed 5 questions to some of the more well-known programmers of today, and their answers made for very interesting reading. Not to say that I&#8217;m a great programmer or anything, but I thought it might be a fun thought exercise to answer these questions myself. Here we go:</p>

<p><strong>How did you learn programming? Were any schools of any use? Or maybe you didn&#8217;t even bother with attending any schools <img src="http://www.analienandastranger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" />  ?</strong></p>

<p>How did I learn programming? There have been several different stages of my development as a programmer. I started out copying BASIC programs from magazines into my Atari 800 and then modifying them to see what would happen. This progressed through the Commodore 64 and Apple II. In the 8th grade I earned the distinction of “Best Programmer,” not that that means very much - I figured out how to make the U.S. flag program run with only a handful of lines of code using loop and control structures vs. typing out the entire graphics display line by line.</p>

<p>In High School I jumped to the exciting world of Quick Basic. I can&#8217;t remember the exact name of the course I took, but it was not very far above the level of what I did in Middle School/Junior High, nor was it very far below the level of my intro-level course in College. As I recall, we spent a lot of time hacking the machines to see what we could do with them. Of course you couldn&#8217;t do anything cool like change your class schedule ala Hackers.</p>

<p>At some point I decided I would major in Computer Science at the University of Mississippi. I really enjoyed my time at Ole Miss, and I learned a lot - unfortunately, I also picked up a lot of bad programming habits. You ask were schools of any use? Definitely - one of my favorite professors secured me an internship at St. Jude, which led to my current and only full-time software development job. It wasn&#8217;t until I started developing real code for real clients that I got truly serious about programming as a profession. It was then that I learned that hacking out quick and dirty scripts that worked most of the time and would get past a graduate assistant&#8217;s grading wasn&#8217;t what programming was all about. I think the turning point of my career was when I attended XP/Agile Universe in 2002. It was here that I really started to grasp agility, test-driven development, refactoring, and simple design - principles and practices that I consider essential to developing software of any magnitude.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think is the most important skill every programmer should possess?</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll answer this question very much like David Heinemeier Hansson answered the 10-100 times question below. I think the ability to quickly view a problem in the abstract and then mentally apply Occam&#8217;s razor to it until you have what is needed for implementation is essential to programming. When I&#8217;m not managing a project team/schedule - i.e. I&#8217;m actually doing software development - I would consider this to be the core of what I do every day.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think mathematics and/or physics are important skills for a programmer? Why?</strong></p>

<p>I can&#8217;t remember ever using any of the physics I&#8217;ve learned. Take that back, the concept of the electromagnetic field was useful when I was trying to understand Mass Spectrometry, which is at the heart of several of my clients&#8217; work. Mathematics, on the other hand, is key. The concepts I learned in my discrete mathematics course seem to lie under the surface of many of the problems that I face. Even if I don&#8217;t directly apply the mathematics on a day-to-day basis, the “way of thinking” that you develop when studying mathematics really sharpens you as a programmer in my opinion.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think will be the next big thing in computer programming? X-oriented programming, Y language, quantum computers, etc?</strong></p>

<p>Like many of those interviewed, I&#8217;m not into fortune telling and/or hype. The next big thing always quickly becomes yesterday&#8217;s news as we cut through the hype to the core value of what product/technique/practice X offers. We then integrate that core value into our regular day-to-day toolset and then go back to business as usual.</p>

<p><strong>If you had three months to learn one relatively new technology, which one would you choose?</strong></p>

<p>THREE MONTHS?!?!? WOW! Although it isn&#8217;t that new, it&#8217;s still fairly new to me. I would spend the next three months learning everything I can about <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">the Spring framework</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think makes some programmers 10 or 100 times more productive than others?</strong></p>

<p>This flies in the face of a lot of the agile methodologies out there, but I think solving as many problems as you can without interrupting any of your other team members will turn you into an uber-productive programmer. I taught myself 90% of what I know through self-study and independent troubleshooting. If every time you have an issue with your work you quickly run to someone on your team that “knows that software/technology/issue better,” you&#8217;ll never advance past infancy as a programmer. Just like babies have to be spoon-fed, so do infant programmers. You have to learn how to feed yourself. The next time you have a problem in code that you&#8217;re not familiar with, trace the execution, line-by-line. Understand for yourself how the program works. If you run across a technology or API that you&#8217;re not familiar with, study the available resources related to it. “Google it” for crying out loud. The more you do this, the better you&#8217;ll get at it. Soon you&#8217;ll find yourself asking questions of your team members only about 5% of the time, and you&#8217;ll become the most productive member of your team. Don&#8217;t believe me? Give it a try.</p>

<p><strong>What are your favorite tools (operating system, programming/scripting language, text editor, version control system, shell, database engine, other tools you can&#8217;t live without) and why do you like them more than others?</strong></p>

<p>My current tool set includes IntelliJ IDEA (as well as a smattering of Eclipse when I need it), <a href="http://www.appfuse.org/">AppFuse</a> - probably the best thing that has ever happened to J2EE development, Cygwin, Tomcat, and MySQL. If I&#8217;m doing anything else in a text editor besides coding, vim is my friend. Wiki-wise we&#8217;re very invested in Confluence - it rocks as a wiki. Of course I really can&#8217;t live without Firefox - besides my IDE I probably spend more time there than anywhere else.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite book related to computer programming?</strong></p>

<p>I think I have to call a tie here between <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0135974445/sr=8-2/qid=1153761714/ref=pd_bbs_2/102-7769528-6502532?ie=UTF8">Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices</a> by Robert C. Martin and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131016490/sr=1-1/qid=1153761786/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-7769528-6502532?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Test Driven Development: A Practical Guide</a> by David Astels.  Both of these books were instrumental in my development as a more agile developer.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite book NOT related to computer programming?</strong></p>

<p>This is an easy one - the Bible.  My main translation is the <a href="http://www.esv.org/">English Standard Version</a>.</p>

<p>If I had to choose a book that wasn&#8217;t the Bible, it would be <a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=102">The Way of the Master</a> by Ray Comfort.  This book literally changed my life.</p>

<p><strong>What are your favorite music bands/performers/composers?</strong></p>

<p>Right now my favorite artists include The David Crowder Band, Casting Crowns, and Todd Agnew.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2695/522/1600/Adrian_Rogers2.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2695/522/320/Adrian_Rogers2.jpg" alt="" /></a><br/>
This morning, Dr. Adrian Rogers walked into glory. Dr. Rogers was my first pastor. I never had the opportunity to share this with him, but he is ultimately the man who led me to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. I experienced false conversion as a child, was never baptized, and never experienced the true change of heart that comes from the new birth. Shortly after our marriage, my wife and I joined Bellevue Baptist Church, where I was then baptized. I realized that I knew very little about the foundations of my faith, so when I learned that Dr. Rogers taught a course on Wednesday nights called &#8220;Back to the Basics: What Every Christian Ought to Know,&#8221; I quickly signed up. It was the second or third week of the class when Dr. Rogers spoke on the subject, &#8220;How to Be Saved and Know It.&#8221; During this class Dr. Rogers revealed that as a young man he had struggled with doubting his salvation.</p>

<p>Quoting from <a href="http://www.bellevue.org/templates/cusbellevue1103/details.asp?id=1360&amp;PID=33044&amp;mast=">this message</a>, Adrian Rogers said, &#8220;One night I looked up into the heavens and said, &#8216;God, I&#8217;ve got to have assurance. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m lost and the Holy Spirit has me under conviction, or I&#8217;m saved and the devil is trying to get me to doubt my salvation. But one thing I know: You said if I would believe on You, You would save me. So, Lord, right now, I trust You to save me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I went home that evening and prayed that very prayer, and the rest is spiritual history. Though I didn&#8217;t become instantly perfect (and I&#8217;m still quite far away from perfection), I finally experienced that change of heart and life that comes from salvation. I&#8217;ve since been baptized again (to get it in the right order), as after the self-examination commanded by <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013:5;&amp;version=31;">2 Corinthians 13:5</a> I realized that that night was when I was truly saved.   So, to Heaven I send a heartfelt thank you to Dr. Adrian Rogers, and I look forward to seeing him again one day.</p>

<p>Besides him leading me to Christ, if that wasn&#8217;t enough, I&#8217;ve learned a great deal from Dr. Rogers about what it means to be a man of God and a great husband and father. He&#8217;s taught me from the pulpit, from books, and from personal example. He truly was, and still is, a good and faithful servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It appears that Ruby on Rails is changing the WORLD of software development - I wasn&#8217;t aware of just how much influence it was having in the world of other languages. Here Marc Fleury (JBoss CEO) says that it had a huge influence on Seam - JBoss&#8217;s venture into the Java web framework space. And then the list of RoR clones: Biscuit (PHP), Grails (Java), Monorail (.NET), Turbo Gears (Python), Cake PHP, Subway (Python), Catalyst (Perl)&#8230;..All I can say is that the RoR guys must have done something right!</p>
