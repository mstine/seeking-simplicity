  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ended up at the restaurant across the street from the one pictured in my last entry. I found out from reading the reviews that it was the original, and then opened an additional location across the street. Strange, huh? At any rate, the Chicken Satay was definitely a 5-star dish for me. Even better than Bhan Thai back home in Memphis. I followed that up w/ the Thai Fried Rice w/ Beef. Also awesome. I will probably eat here again during the week.</p>

<p>This is the view from my quaint little hotel room at the Hotel Nikko in downtown San Francisco, California. I arrived here after a long morning of travel. First ~4 hours of flight from Memphis, TN to San Francisco International, followed by traversing the airport maze to find the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) train station. Once I found the right station, it was another 15 minutes of waiting on a train followed by a 40 minute train ride. Almost home? Not quite. As I ride the escalator out of the subway, I realize just what a country boy I am. There are literally hundreds of people crawling around on the streets, and here I am, toting a large rolling suitcase, a laptop, and a backpack, and looking totally clueless! Where is my hotel? I was definitely a prime target for predators just looking to make a quick buck. Within seconds I heard, &#8220;Where you looking to go? I&#8217;ve got a map.&#8221; I quickly responds with &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it, thanks.&#8221; Of course, I didn&#8217;t have it. But I didn&#8217;t have 20 bucks for the guy either! Not a few more steps up the sidewalk I&#8217;m confronted by Indian monks wanting to share their religion with me. I did have a nice conversation with this guy and got him to take one of my pocket Gospels of John (thank you Pocket Testament League!). Finally a nice family pointed me in the right direction. I figured out that if you look like you&#8217;re on a mission and you know what you&#8217;re doing, people don&#8217;t come up to you, so I put on my best serious face and headed for the Hotel Nikko. Now here I am, and from my window I&#8217;ve got a nice view of the pool area which is surrounded by an interesting looking rock garden:</p>

<p>I also can see what looks like a potentially good Thai restaurant on the corner:</p>

<p>The reviews on Google Maps look promising!</p>

<p>On a final note for this entry, I desperately miss my family. Our goodbye at Memphis International was tear-filled, especially by Wendy. I haven&#8217;t been this far away from them in a LOOOOONG time. In fact, Abby was only about 10 months old the last time I went on a business trip without them. Isabella and Ali Kate weren&#8217;t even conceived yet! I managed to get a web camera for the trip, so I&#8217;m going to send them a video message every day. Check your email sweetheart! I love you all SO MUCH!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to everyone who pointed me to <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections/">Commons Collections</a> and its <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections/api-release/org/apache/commons/collections/functors/package-summary.html">Functor package</a> yesterday. To me, this is just one step below having closures natively present in the language. FYI, I was able to remove all duplication from my class and reduce the LOC from 211 to 136 - in other words, 75 lines of useless code GONE.</p>

<p>Here is what I did. First, I defined Predicates for each of my conditions. The simplest ones called a boolean method on the User object:</p>

<pre><code>private final Predicate isX = new Predicate() {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  public boolean evaluate(Object object) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;     return ((User) object).isX();&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  }&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Only slightly more complicated ones checked to see if a given Collection was empty on the User object:</p>

<pre><code>private final Predicate isX = new Predicate() {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  public boolean evaluate(Object object) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;     return CollectionUtils.isNotEmpty(((User) object).getItems());&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  }&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I defined a method that would check the delegations for the User to see if any of them were an X:</p>

<pre><code>boolean checkDelegations(User user, Predicate checkPredicate) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  return CollectionUtils.exists(user.getDelegations(), checkPredicate);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I implemented the security methods:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean canDoThis() {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  return isX.evaluate(loggedInUser) || checkDelegations(loggedInUser, isX);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe it isn’t the most elegant or simplest of solutions, but it sure is a lot better than what I posted yesterday!</p>

<p>P.S. Since this is a Christian blog, I must remind you that RTFM stands for Read The <strong>FINE</strong> Manual!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m sure everyone is sick of reading this same rant over and over, but I just had to add more fuel to the fire. I’m attempting to implement access privilege delegation in a JSF application - basically, users can delegate their ability to do “stuff” in our application to other users. I have a backing bean that has several methods that are called by the JSF components, returning whether or not to render that component based on security privileges. Well, I now have to make all of those methods aware of delegation! I have something like this in several methods:</p>

<pre><code>boolean notX = (loggedInUser.isX());&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;if (notX) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  boolean result = false;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  Set delegations = loggedInUser.getDelegations();&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  for (Iterator i = delegations.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;     User delegator = (User) i.next();&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;     if (delegator.isX()) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;        result = true;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;        break;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;     }&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  }&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  return result;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;} else {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  return true;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, it would be nice if I could extract the contents of that if block into a new method, say “checkDelegations()”. Unfortunately, the isX() that I need to call is different for every method following this pattern. I’d like to be able to pass a function that calls isX() on the delegator into the checkDelegations() method. No dice in Java. Does anyone else have a solution to this problem?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Raible updated the <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/wiki/AppFuseRoadmap.html">AppFuseRoadmap</a> yesterday. I’m really excited about where the project is going. XDoclet has been a good friend, but I’m really happy to see its demise in favor of annotations. JDK 5 and JSP 2.0 will also be really helpful - I’ve wanted to leverage these technologies for a long time, but haven’t had an easy way to do so. I think the most interesting thing for me will be the switch over to Maven 2. I have absolutely ZERO experience with Maven, other that seeing the pretty websites that it generates for many of my favorite open source projects. I consider myself to be something of an Ant wizard, so I hope that I’ll be able to leverage that experience in Maven.</p>

<p>It looks like TestNG replacing JUnit is a nice-to-have for 2.0 - I hope this becomes a configuration option. I don’t know anything about TestNG. Perhaps it’s time to learn. <img src="http://www.analienandastranger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>AppFuse 2.2 is where things are really going to start getting cool. Convention over configuration (ala RoR) will really speed development, and features by plugin will make my life really easier. I spend a lot of time stripping things out that I don’t need for particular projects - the time I save by using AppFuse is worth the pain of stripping them out - so this will be yet another way that AppFuse will make Java EE development a pleasure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found <a href="http://blogs.opensymphony.com/plightbo/2006/08/project_able_a_complete_java_w.html">Project Able</a> while reading <a href="http://www.analienandastranger.com/?p=25">Raible’s blog</a> this morning. While it doesn’t claim to duplicate everything that AppFuse does (i.e. they pick a framework and stick with it instead of providing choice), they are doing some neat things. I may take a look at it if I ever have time. <img src="http://www.analienandastranger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<blockquote><p>Project Able is a full Java-based web development stack designed to make web development painless. In a sense, it is an attempt to bring together quality opensource tools in one cohesive stack, similar to what Rails has done for Ruby, while also encouraging common practices I’ve used in software engineering for a long time.</p>

<p>It is very similar to projects such as Trails, Grails, and AppFuse. However, there are a few key differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>The stack components are different (WebWork, Spring, iBatis, etc).</li>
<li>In addition to the basic framework, Able also encourages common development techniques and patterns (more below).</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve wanted for some time now to write a blog entry promoting my favorite open source project - AppFuse. Since I started developing web applications using AppFuse as a base, I can truly say that I’ve rediscovered the joy of software development. I’ve found no other technology or methodology that has allowed me to place as much focus as I now do on solving business problems and not on technology ramp-up or figuring out the eccentricities of “framework X.” In this article, <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/">Matt Raible</a>, the founder of the <a href="http://www.appfuse.org/">AppFuse</a> project, humbly states very compelling reasons that you should use AppFuse for your J2EE development. To summarize, here are the 7 reaons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Integration</li>
<li>Automation</li>
<li>Security Features and Extensibility</li>
<li>Code Generation with AppGen</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Community</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently finished integrating <a href="http://http//www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a> with AppFuse for a project I&#8217;m working on. JFreeChart is a really powerful Java chart library. If your application has any requirements for charts/graphs, I highly recommend it. The user manual and demo code come with a price tag ($39.95 for a single developer), but they are well worth the purchase - especially the demo code. If you don&#8217;t have the $$$, the <a href="http://www.jfree.org/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=3">support forum</a> is also very helpful.</p>

<p>I plan to put together a tutorial to help anyone interested in using JFreeChart in their AppFuse application. Look for it here and on the appfuse-user mailing list. It will be based on JSF since that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m using right now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently Matt Raible thought my JSF modifications to the AppFuse-Compass tutorial were good enough to merit a mention on his blog: <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/page/rd?entry=appfuse_videos_updated_for_1">AppFuse Videos updated for 1.9.3</a>.  Check out the bottom of the entry.</p>

<p>Compass really is a nice tool - I was able to provide search capabilities for an app I&#8217;m working on right now with about 2 days worth of work (having never worked w/ Compass before), and man is it fast! I can&#8217;t get a search to exceed 1.5 seconds!</p>
