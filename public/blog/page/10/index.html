It&#8217;s Friday night, and what am I doing but coding. My wife&#8217;s night out is spent at the scrapbook store working on her latest layouts - mine is at my new favorite coffee shop, working on open source. I discovered this place on a date with Wendy a couple of months ago. The nice thing about it is the distinctly Christian atmosphere. A good friend of mine and I meet here on Friday mornings for accountability. Well, since they hand out free wireless internet, I thought I&#8217;d drop by for my night out as well. Good coding atmosphere - I have a nice corner with a plugin for my laptop, so I&#8217;m good to go. Check this place out if you&#8217;re in DeSoto County, MS or the Memphis metro area anytime soon - <a href="http://grovecoffeehouse.com">http://grovecoffeehouse.com</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently migrated all of my Java/Development related posts from <a href="http://www.analienandastranger.com">http://www.analienandastranger.com</a>. I want to make this a PRIMARILY Java/Development-related blog. When I was splitting my efforts between Christianity and Software Development, I was quickly getting burned out and not writing anything. If you want to read any of my old devotional posts, I will be keeping the other blog alive for awhile. Since the hosting is being provided to me free (as well as the domain), I will in good conscience need to shut it down eventually. I just feel that using Blogger gives me greater visibility - I do want people to actually read this stuff, ya know? :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/matt.stine/SanFranciscoJavaOne2007/photo#5063512122879158706"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/matt.stine/RkU1crgYqbI/AAAAAAAAAOI/fn4ypOF5zkQ/s288/DSCN1138.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I really enjoyed &#8220;The Toy Show&#8221; this morning. James Gosling went through a flurry of different demos from around the &#8220;cool&#8221; Java world. I was especially impressed with Project Wonderland (http://lg3d-wonderland.dev.java.net/), a virtual workplace environment, and with the real-time robotics demos. Unfortunately I was so sucked in that I didn&#8217;t get any good photos.</p>

<p>If anything you could call this my day on the back end. I attended four sessions, two of which were focused on that.</p>

<ul>
<li>Comparing the Developer Experience of Java EE 5.0, Ruby on Rails, and Grails: Lessons Learned from Developing One Application</li>
<li>Implementing Java EE Applications Using Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 3 Technology: Real-World Tips, Tricks, and New Design Patterns</li>
<li>The Top 10 Ways to Botch Enterprise Java Technology-Based Application Scalability and Reliability</li>
<li>Exploting JRuby: Building Domain-Specific Languages for the Java Virtual Machine</li>
</ul>


<p>I scheduled the first session because I thought it was be a good way to tie together all that I had learned about Grails and Rails and then compare it to my existing Java EE knowledge. As it turns out, the speaker believed that given tool support, the development experience wasn&#8217;t all that different between the three. He then gave some performance comparisons, but I wasn&#8217;t all that sure the analysis was very sound. Java EE came out way on top. I hadn&#8217;t heard that it outperformed the others by quite as much as he showed. He made a rather dubious statement when he said that Grails and Rails weren&#8217;t protected by standards. Groovy is a JSR and Grails just sits on top of it. If that isn&#8217;t standard protection, then what is?</p>

<p>The EJB tips, tricks, and patterns session was quite nice. I learned a few nuances of the platform. The patterns part was the best. They first went through some of the design patterns from the EJB 2.x days and identified which ones were obsolete and which ones were still useful. They then provided several new design patterns. Unfortunately the slides for this talk were not yet available and I just don&#8217;t feel like combing through my handwritten notes. Definitely check this one out online when it is posted.</p>

<p>Cameron Purdy&#8217;s &#8220;Top 10&#8221; talk was both humorous and thought-provoking. I&#8217;ll never do justice to it. Check it out when the video comes available.</p>

<p>The final session of the conference for me addressed a burning question I had in my mind since Monday - what in the world is a DSL? I heard it thrown around in the Grails and Ruby talks at Java University, but nobody ever defined the acronym. Domain Specific Language - that what it is! I mainly attended this talk because I thought there might be applications for DSL&#8217;s in our work at St. Jude. A DSL is a custom language designed for a specific purpose. Ruby&#8217;s Rake language for instrumenting application builds is an example. Rob Harrop gave an impressive demo of how he built two DSL&#8217;s, one providing a simpler API for JMX, and another for corporate action entitlement calculations. While I can&#8217;t think of a direct application for DSL&#8217;s yet, I&#8217;m not tossing out the possibility.</p>

<p>JavaOne was a great conference for me. If I didn&#8217;t hate to leave my family for this long, I&#8217;d love to attend every year. It&#8217;s definitely drinking from a fire hydrant.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>for me, not for JavaOne. Of course I was a good little programmer and used the schedule builder to sign up for all of my sessions. I edited them a bit after the first two keynotes. Even then, I had one lone session scheduled for Thursday morning (that wasn&#8217;t really directly applicable to my work, it just looked interesting), and then two sessions in the afternoon, the first starting at 4:10. I decided to skip out on the morning session and do a little shopping at Pier 39. The highlight was a &#8220;Bucket of Boat Trash&#8221; and clam chowder at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company. And yes, we Ole Miss Rebels are represented as far out as the end of Pier 39:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/matt.stine/SanFranciscoJavaOne2007/photo#5063511710562298018"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/matt.stine/RkU1ErgYqKI/AAAAAAAAAMA/6BJ0mkhqgn8/s288/DSCN1117.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The two sessions that I attended were:</p>

<ul>
<li>RubyTooling: State of the Art</li>
<li>Using Ajax with POJC (Plain Old JavaServer Faces Components)</li>
</ul>


<p>I attended the first session simply to get a little more detail on all of the hype surrounding Ruby tooling support in NetBeans 6. What I got was even more than I bargained for. The project leaders actually walked us through not only the features that were available, but how they were implemented. I had never really thought about the problems with providing code completion and refactoring with a dynamically-typed language. It was really cool to see the thought process that went into their solutions. I&#8217;d love to hear a similar discussion from the JetBrains guys, as the Ruby support in IntelliJ IDEA is quite good as well.</p>

<p>For me the second session was the best of the conference for me up until that point, and arguably it still is after attending Friday&#8217;s sessions. Craig McClanahan, of Struts fame, was the main speaker and was joined by his colleagues Matthew Bohm and Jayashri Visvanathan. What made this session so good for me was that they presented a problem - &#8220;How can I add Ajax behaviors to my JavaServer™ Faces technology based application, without throwing away my investment in existing component libraries?&#8221; - and then provided three different solutions to that problem - low, medium, and high level.</p>

<p>The low level consisted of simply using the HTML event pass-through attributes that are implemented by most standard JSF components (onClick, onBlur, etc.). One could use an existing JavaScript framework such as Dojo to send an XMLHttpRequest and then map that request to a Servlet or JSF handler using a technology such as Shale Remoting. The response could be sent back as JSON data which could then be transformed into the desired UI update.</p>

<p>The medium level consisted of actually extending existing JSF components and adding the desired Ajax behavior. Due to time constraints they didn&#8217;t cover this solution in detail, but they did provide a link to a detailed discussion in the Java BluePrints catalog: https://blueprints.dev.java.net/bpcatalog/ee5/ajax/extendingRenderFunctionality.html</p>

<p>The high level solutions addressed the following needs (copied directly from the slides):</p>

<p>● Partial page submit—gather up a particular set of<br/>
input element values, and send them to a bit of server<br/>
side business logic<br/>
● Partial page refresh—the business logic needs to<br/>
refresh the content of one or more subtrees of the<br/>
client side DOM<br/>
● Synchronization—the benefits of synchronizing the<br/>
server side state<br/>
● Don’t repeat yourself (DRY)—reuse existing<br/>
components and renderers for partial page updates</p>

<p>To address these issues, the speakers highlighted two add-on frameworks:</p>

<p>● Ajax4JSF (http://labs.jboss.com/portal/jbossajax4jsf)<br/>
● Dynamic Faces (https://jsf-extensions.dev.java.net/)</p>

<p>I was quite impressed with both of these frameworks. One of my colleagues is currently implementing Ajax behavior in a Facelets-based application using Ajax4JSF and he is quite happy with it. Dynamic Faces looked really awesome, especially its tooling support in NetBeans (actually I&#8217;m quite impressed with the overall JSF support in NetBeans - I&#8217;ll definitely be adding it to my tool belt). The highlight of the presentation was Matt&#8217;s video of him building an entire currency trading application in 28 minutes - except it was &#8220;fast-played&#8221; to finish in 3 1/2 minutes and set to techno music. Matt wowed us with his dancing abilities while we watched true RAD. The crowd went wild!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not officially, but nearly every session I attended had something to do with AJAX:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating Amazing Web Interfaces with Ajax</li>
<li>jMaki: Web 2.0 App Building Made Easy</li>
<li>Fast, Beautiful, Easy: Pick Three - Building Web User Interfaces in the Java Programming Language with Google Web Toolkit</li>
<li>Killer JavaScript Technology Frameworks for Java Platform Developers: An Exploration of Prototype, Script.aculo.us, and Rico</li>
</ul>


<p>I have to say that I was rather impressed by what I saw.</p>

<p>The first talk was by Ben and Dion, the Ajaxian guys. It was an appropriate way to start, as they gave a quick history overview of Ajax. One nice point they made was that Ajax really isn&#8217;t about the acronym - it never was - it&#8217;s about building killer websites. Who cares what the actual technology behind it is. They discussed a couple of what they seemed to consider the better frameworks available - Dojo and ExtJS. They then explored some amazing up and coming features, including offline support and 2D client side graphics manipulation.</p>

<p>I was rather impressed with jMaki - in short it is a wrapper around many of the popular JavaScript frameworks available (Dojo, Yahoo UI, Script.aculo.us, Spry, Google), and makes them accessible to Java, PHP, and Ruby. It has excellent tool support in NetBeans and Eclipse. It provides protection from changes in the API&#8217;s of all of these projects - you can mix and match frameworks and only be concerned about one API - jMaki&#8217;s. It does the work of linking all of the widgets together and communicating amongst them and with the server side.</p>

<p>The GWT talk was easily my favorite of the day. I&#8217;m extremely impressed with what these guys have done. I hadn&#8217;t had much opportunity to look at GWT until now, and I really wish I had. I was initially skeptical about writing an entire application in Java and letting it generate HTML and JavaScript. I guess these guys knew that, because they&#8217;re development philosophy addresses my concerns quite nicely:</p>

<p>To radically improve the web experience for<br/>
users by enabling developers to use existing<br/>
Java tools to build no-compromise AJAX for<br/>
any modern browser</p>

<p>From what I can see, they deliver on their mission. They&#8217;ve optimized their code for speed and for browser specificity (e.g. from what I understand, if your client is using Firefox, you get Firefox optimized JavaScript, same for IE, etc.). You can use all of your favorite IDE features to build the code, including the debugger. I really want to try to make use of this toolkit in the near future.</p>

<p>The final talk was less informative for me, but only because I had experience with most of the technologies already. The killer part of this was how the speaker extended existing JSF components and added Script.aculo.us effects. It really made his version of Yahoo maps shine.</p>

<p>Ajax isn&#8217;t going anywhere but up. I just left yet another Ajax/JSF session, which for me was the best session of the conference so far. In a later entry I&#8217;ll tell you why.</p>

<p>It has been a whirlwind of a day. I&#8217;ve been to two keynotes (close to 5 hours of information there) and one technical session. Couple that information with what I heard at Java University yesterday, and you find many common themes. One that keeps coming up is the emerging trend of making other languages, particularly dynamic/scripting languages, first-class citizens on the JVM.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, &#8220;Dynamic programming language is a term used broadly in computer science to describe a class of high level programming languages that execute at runtime many common behaviors that other languages might perform during compilation, if at all. These behaviors could include extension of the program, by adding new code, or by extending objects and definitions, or by modifying the type system, all during program execution. These behaviors can be emulated in nearly any language of sufficient complexity, but dynamic languages provide direct tools to make use of them.&#8221; This definition seems to fit quite nicely with what I&#8217;ve heard the last two days. A couple of dynamic languages I&#8217;ve heard A LOT about are Groovy and Ruby.</p>

<p>Yes, Ruby and its most popular framework, Ruby on Rails, have survived the initial hype. They are here to stay. Not only that, they seem poised to make a serious impact on the way we will do web application development over the next several years. Sun made a HUGE splash when they decided to hire the core developers of JRuby, the project which in its current pre-1.0 release already runs 98% of Ruby on Rails as a first-class citizen on the JVM. Not only that, you can now create a WAR file from a Ruby on Rails application and deploy it to any Java application server! I&#8217;ll write more on this in another entry as I attended a full technical session on it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re too uncomfortable getting away from Java, why not try Groovy? After all, it is a JSR (241). All of Java syntax is legal in Groovy, plus a lot more. Groovy is a dynamic scripting language like Ruby and also compiles to bytecode, making it a first-class citizen on the JVM. It has its own MVC framework, Grails (formerly Groovy on Rails), which is a direct competitor to Ruby on Rails. I&#8217;ve already written on Groovy and Grails in an earlier entry.</p>

<p>I plan to attend some additional sessions focused on these dynamic languages, as it seems they will be really important in the years to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m currently sitting in this session - Graeme Rocher is the presenter. He is the creator of Grails, which is Groovy&#8217;s answer to the Ruby on Rails like development experience. He&#8217;s currently doing Q&amp;A, so I thought I&#8217;d take the opportunity to write a short entry. So far this session is awesome! Graeme is a great presenter and has had the perfect balance of slides and live coding. Unfortunately they ran out of slides before I got to the presentation (more on the sometimes laughable logistics at JavaOne later), so I&#8217;m having trouble remember details to write about (they&#8217;ve promised to email me the slides). The first part of the session was an introduction to Groovy, Java&#8217;s &#8220;scripting&#8221; language. I had NO IDEA just how cool and powerful Groovy was. I am especially impressed with its MetaClass concept, whereby you can override almost every behavior of the Java language that you can imagine - method calling, operator overloading, etc. Imagine being able to do AOP type things without using AOP. Not only that, it has all of my favorite pet features like &#8220;everything is an object,&#8221; closures, dynamic lists, etc. It&#8217;s an OOP nuts dream. I&#8217;ll write more later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was the first session that I attended at Java University. You could take either a full-day course or two half-day courses - I elected to do the latter. Keith Donald, project lead for Spring WebFlow, presented. I have quite a bit of Spring experience already through AppFuse, but I was hoping to get a more complete view of Spring as most of what I have learned is from tinkering with existing systems. Keith promised that we&#8217;d build a system from the ground up, so it sounded like I&#8217;d get what I bargained for.</p>

<p>And build from the ground up we did. I&#8217;d say we were almost halfway through the entire session before we even TOUCHED Spring. Up until that point all we had done was do test driven development on all of the business entities and logic. It was very interesting to me that Keith&#8217;s coding methodology is quite different from what I typically find myself doing. He implemented almost all of the business logic of the application without any regard to the eventual supporting technologies (i.e. ORM frameworks, web frameworks, etc.). It seems like I almost always bind my application to a set of technologies (say Hibernate/Spring/JSF) before I ever write a line of business logic. What did he get from this? Well, his application had fully implemented and tested business logic that would work with nearly any of the available supporting frameworks. Good stuff.</p>

<p>Another thing that was interesting to me is his disdain for packaging classes according to application layer. I can&#8217;t think of an application that I&#8217;ve built recently where the DAO&#8217;s weren&#8217;t in a dao package, the &#8220;Manager&#8217;s&#8221; weren&#8217;t in a manger/service package, and the web classes weren&#8217;t in a web package. Keith totally changed all of this. Our two main entities in this application were account and restaurant. Anything that had to do with an account (be it a DAO, service bean, web form, etc.) went in the account package. The same went for the restaurant package. I&#8217;m not sure if I like this or not, but he seemed convinced of the value.</p>

<p>Overall it was a good session. He incorporated A LOT of live coding, and almost all of it was done from scracth - he had very little pre-made skeleton code. The drawback to that was that he only made it through 6 of the 8 sections of his slides. I wish he had backed down on one or the other.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ended up at the restaurant across the street from the one pictured in my last entry. I found out from reading the reviews that it was the original, and then opened an additional location across the street. Strange, huh? At any rate, the Chicken Satay was definitely a 5-star dish for me. Even better than Bhan Thai back home in Memphis. I followed that up w/ the Thai Fried Rice w/ Beef. Also awesome. I will probably eat here again during the week.</p>

<p>This is the view from my quaint little hotel room at the Hotel Nikko in downtown San Francisco, California. I arrived here after a long morning of travel. First ~4 hours of flight from Memphis, TN to San Francisco International, followed by traversing the airport maze to find the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) train station. Once I found the right station, it was another 15 minutes of waiting on a train followed by a 40 minute train ride. Almost home? Not quite. As I ride the escalator out of the subway, I realize just what a country boy I am. There are literally hundreds of people crawling around on the streets, and here I am, toting a large rolling suitcase, a laptop, and a backpack, and looking totally clueless! Where is my hotel? I was definitely a prime target for predators just looking to make a quick buck. Within seconds I heard, &#8220;Where you looking to go? I&#8217;ve got a map.&#8221; I quickly responds with &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it, thanks.&#8221; Of course, I didn&#8217;t have it. But I didn&#8217;t have 20 bucks for the guy either! Not a few more steps up the sidewalk I&#8217;m confronted by Indian monks wanting to share their religion with me. I did have a nice conversation with this guy and got him to take one of my pocket Gospels of John (thank you Pocket Testament League!). Finally a nice family pointed me in the right direction. I figured out that if you look like you&#8217;re on a mission and you know what you&#8217;re doing, people don&#8217;t come up to you, so I put on my best serious face and headed for the Hotel Nikko. Now here I am, and from my window I&#8217;ve got a nice view of the pool area which is surrounded by an interesting looking rock garden:</p>

<p>I also can see what looks like a potentially good Thai restaurant on the corner:</p>

<p>The reviews on Google Maps look promising!</p>

<p>On a final note for this entry, I desperately miss my family. Our goodbye at Memphis International was tear-filled, especially by Wendy. I haven&#8217;t been this far away from them in a LOOOOONG time. In fact, Abby was only about 10 months old the last time I went on a business trip without them. Isabella and Ali Kate weren&#8217;t even conceived yet! I managed to get a web camera for the trip, so I&#8217;m going to send them a video message every day. Check your email sweetheart! I love you all SO MUCH!</p>
