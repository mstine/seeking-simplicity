<p>It has been a whirlwind of a day. I&#8217;ve been to two keynotes (close to 5 hours of information there) and one technical session. Couple that information with what I heard at Java University yesterday, and you find many common themes. One that keeps coming up is the emerging trend of making other languages, particularly dynamic/scripting languages, first-class citizens on the JVM.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, &#8220;Dynamic programming language is a term used broadly in computer science to describe a class of high level programming languages that execute at runtime many common behaviors that other languages might perform during compilation, if at all. These behaviors could include extension of the program, by adding new code, or by extending objects and definitions, or by modifying the type system, all during program execution. These behaviors can be emulated in nearly any language of sufficient complexity, but dynamic languages provide direct tools to make use of them.&#8221; This definition seems to fit quite nicely with what I&#8217;ve heard the last two days. A couple of dynamic languages I&#8217;ve heard A LOT about are Groovy and Ruby.</p>

<p>Yes, Ruby and its most popular framework, Ruby on Rails, have survived the initial hype. They are here to stay. Not only that, they seem poised to make a serious impact on the way we will do web application development over the next several years. Sun made a HUGE splash when they decided to hire the core developers of JRuby, the project which in its current pre-1.0 release already runs 98% of Ruby on Rails as a first-class citizen on the JVM. Not only that, you can now create a WAR file from a Ruby on Rails application and deploy it to any Java application server! I&#8217;ll write more on this in another entry as I attended a full technical session on it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re too uncomfortable getting away from Java, why not try Groovy? After all, it is a JSR (241). All of Java syntax is legal in Groovy, plus a lot more. Groovy is a dynamic scripting language like Ruby and also compiles to bytecode, making it a first-class citizen on the JVM. It has its own MVC framework, Grails (formerly Groovy on Rails), which is a direct competitor to Ruby on Rails. I&#8217;ve already written on Groovy and Grails in an earlier entry.</p>

<p>I plan to attend some additional sessions focused on these dynamic languages, as it seems they will be really important in the years to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m currently sitting in this session - Graeme Rocher is the presenter. He is the creator of Grails, which is Groovy&#8217;s answer to the Ruby on Rails like development experience. He&#8217;s currently doing Q&amp;A, so I thought I&#8217;d take the opportunity to write a short entry. So far this session is awesome! Graeme is a great presenter and has had the perfect balance of slides and live coding. Unfortunately they ran out of slides before I got to the presentation (more on the sometimes laughable logistics at JavaOne later), so I&#8217;m having trouble remember details to write about (they&#8217;ve promised to email me the slides). The first part of the session was an introduction to Groovy, Java&#8217;s &#8220;scripting&#8221; language. I had NO IDEA just how cool and powerful Groovy was. I am especially impressed with its MetaClass concept, whereby you can override almost every behavior of the Java language that you can imagine - method calling, operator overloading, etc. Imagine being able to do AOP type things without using AOP. Not only that, it has all of my favorite pet features like &#8220;everything is an object,&#8221; closures, dynamic lists, etc. It&#8217;s an OOP nuts dream. I&#8217;ll write more later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was the first session that I attended at Java University. You could take either a full-day course or two half-day courses - I elected to do the latter. Keith Donald, project lead for Spring WebFlow, presented. I have quite a bit of Spring experience already through AppFuse, but I was hoping to get a more complete view of Spring as most of what I have learned is from tinkering with existing systems. Keith promised that we&#8217;d build a system from the ground up, so it sounded like I&#8217;d get what I bargained for.</p>

<p>And build from the ground up we did. I&#8217;d say we were almost halfway through the entire session before we even TOUCHED Spring. Up until that point all we had done was do test driven development on all of the business entities and logic. It was very interesting to me that Keith&#8217;s coding methodology is quite different from what I typically find myself doing. He implemented almost all of the business logic of the application without any regard to the eventual supporting technologies (i.e. ORM frameworks, web frameworks, etc.). It seems like I almost always bind my application to a set of technologies (say Hibernate/Spring/JSF) before I ever write a line of business logic. What did he get from this? Well, his application had fully implemented and tested business logic that would work with nearly any of the available supporting frameworks. Good stuff.</p>

<p>Another thing that was interesting to me is his disdain for packaging classes according to application layer. I can&#8217;t think of an application that I&#8217;ve built recently where the DAO&#8217;s weren&#8217;t in a dao package, the &#8220;Manager&#8217;s&#8221; weren&#8217;t in a manger/service package, and the web classes weren&#8217;t in a web package. Keith totally changed all of this. Our two main entities in this application were account and restaurant. Anything that had to do with an account (be it a DAO, service bean, web form, etc.) went in the account package. The same went for the restaurant package. I&#8217;m not sure if I like this or not, but he seemed convinced of the value.</p>

<p>Overall it was a good session. He incorporated A LOT of live coding, and almost all of it was done from scracth - he had very little pre-made skeleton code. The drawback to that was that he only made it through 6 of the 8 sections of his slides. I wish he had backed down on one or the other.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ended up at the restaurant across the street from the one pictured in my last entry. I found out from reading the reviews that it was the original, and then opened an additional location across the street. Strange, huh? At any rate, the Chicken Satay was definitely a 5-star dish for me. Even better than Bhan Thai back home in Memphis. I followed that up w/ the Thai Fried Rice w/ Beef. Also awesome. I will probably eat here again during the week.</p>

<p>This is the view from my quaint little hotel room at the Hotel Nikko in downtown San Francisco, California. I arrived here after a long morning of travel. First ~4 hours of flight from Memphis, TN to San Francisco International, followed by traversing the airport maze to find the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) train station. Once I found the right station, it was another 15 minutes of waiting on a train followed by a 40 minute train ride. Almost home? Not quite. As I ride the escalator out of the subway, I realize just what a country boy I am. There are literally hundreds of people crawling around on the streets, and here I am, toting a large rolling suitcase, a laptop, and a backpack, and looking totally clueless! Where is my hotel? I was definitely a prime target for predators just looking to make a quick buck. Within seconds I heard, &#8220;Where you looking to go? I&#8217;ve got a map.&#8221; I quickly responds with &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it, thanks.&#8221; Of course, I didn&#8217;t have it. But I didn&#8217;t have 20 bucks for the guy either! Not a few more steps up the sidewalk I&#8217;m confronted by Indian monks wanting to share their religion with me. I did have a nice conversation with this guy and got him to take one of my pocket Gospels of John (thank you Pocket Testament League!). Finally a nice family pointed me in the right direction. I figured out that if you look like you&#8217;re on a mission and you know what you&#8217;re doing, people don&#8217;t come up to you, so I put on my best serious face and headed for the Hotel Nikko. Now here I am, and from my window I&#8217;ve got a nice view of the pool area which is surrounded by an interesting looking rock garden:</p>

<p>I also can see what looks like a potentially good Thai restaurant on the corner:</p>

<p>The reviews on Google Maps look promising!</p>

<p>On a final note for this entry, I desperately miss my family. Our goodbye at Memphis International was tear-filled, especially by Wendy. I haven&#8217;t been this far away from them in a LOOOOONG time. In fact, Abby was only about 10 months old the last time I went on a business trip without them. Isabella and Ali Kate weren&#8217;t even conceived yet! I managed to get a web camera for the trip, so I&#8217;m going to send them a video message every day. Check your email sweetheart! I love you all SO MUCH!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to everyone who pointed me to <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections/">Commons Collections</a> and its <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections/api-release/org/apache/commons/collections/functors/package-summary.html">Functor package</a> yesterday. To me, this is just one step below having closures natively present in the language. FYI, I was able to remove all duplication from my class and reduce the LOC from 211 to 136 - in other words, 75 lines of useless code GONE.</p>

<p>Here is what I did. First, I defined Predicates for each of my conditions. The simplest ones called a boolean method on the User object:</p>

<pre><code>private final Predicate isX = new Predicate() {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  public boolean evaluate(Object object) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;     return ((User) object).isX();&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  }&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Only slightly more complicated ones checked to see if a given Collection was empty on the User object:</p>

<pre><code>private final Predicate isX = new Predicate() {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  public boolean evaluate(Object object) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;     return CollectionUtils.isNotEmpty(((User) object).getItems());&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  }&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I defined a method that would check the delegations for the User to see if any of them were an X:</p>

<pre><code>boolean checkDelegations(User user, Predicate checkPredicate) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  return CollectionUtils.exists(user.getDelegations(), checkPredicate);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I implemented the security methods:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean canDoThis() {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  return isX.evaluate(loggedInUser) || checkDelegations(loggedInUser, isX);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe it isn’t the most elegant or simplest of solutions, but it sure is a lot better than what I posted yesterday!</p>

<p>P.S. Since this is a Christian blog, I must remind you that RTFM stands for Read The <strong>FINE</strong> Manual!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m sure everyone is sick of reading this same rant over and over, but I just had to add more fuel to the fire. I’m attempting to implement access privilege delegation in a JSF application - basically, users can delegate their ability to do “stuff” in our application to other users. I have a backing bean that has several methods that are called by the JSF components, returning whether or not to render that component based on security privileges. Well, I now have to make all of those methods aware of delegation! I have something like this in several methods:</p>

<pre><code>boolean notX = (loggedInUser.isX());&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;if (notX) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  boolean result = false;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  Set delegations = loggedInUser.getDelegations();&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  for (Iterator i = delegations.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;     User delegator = (User) i.next();&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;     if (delegator.isX()) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;        result = true;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;        break;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;     }&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  }&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  return result;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;} else {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  return true;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, it would be nice if I could extract the contents of that if block into a new method, say “checkDelegations()”. Unfortunately, the isX() that I need to call is different for every method following this pattern. I’d like to be able to pass a function that calls isX() on the delegator into the checkDelegations() method. No dice in Java. Does anyone else have a solution to this problem?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Raible updated the <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/wiki/AppFuseRoadmap.html">AppFuseRoadmap</a> yesterday. I’m really excited about where the project is going. XDoclet has been a good friend, but I’m really happy to see its demise in favor of annotations. JDK 5 and JSP 2.0 will also be really helpful - I’ve wanted to leverage these technologies for a long time, but haven’t had an easy way to do so. I think the most interesting thing for me will be the switch over to Maven 2. I have absolutely ZERO experience with Maven, other that seeing the pretty websites that it generates for many of my favorite open source projects. I consider myself to be something of an Ant wizard, so I hope that I’ll be able to leverage that experience in Maven.</p>

<p>It looks like TestNG replacing JUnit is a nice-to-have for 2.0 - I hope this becomes a configuration option. I don’t know anything about TestNG. Perhaps it’s time to learn. <img src="http://www.analienandastranger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>AppFuse 2.2 is where things are really going to start getting cool. Convention over configuration (ala RoR) will really speed development, and features by plugin will make my life really easier. I spend a lot of time stripping things out that I don’t need for particular projects - the time I save by using AppFuse is worth the pain of stripping them out - so this will be yet another way that AppFuse will make Java EE development a pleasure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found <a href="http://blogs.opensymphony.com/plightbo/2006/08/project_able_a_complete_java_w.html">Project Able</a> while reading <a href="http://www.analienandastranger.com/?p=25">Raible’s blog</a> this morning. While it doesn’t claim to duplicate everything that AppFuse does (i.e. they pick a framework and stick with it instead of providing choice), they are doing some neat things. I may take a look at it if I ever have time. <img src="http://www.analienandastranger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<blockquote><p>Project Able is a full Java-based web development stack designed to make web development painless. In a sense, it is an attempt to bring together quality opensource tools in one cohesive stack, similar to what Rails has done for Ruby, while also encouraging common practices I’ve used in software engineering for a long time.</p>

<p>It is very similar to projects such as Trails, Grails, and AppFuse. However, there are a few key differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>The stack components are different (WebWork, Spring, iBatis, etc).</li>
<li>In addition to the basic framework, Able also encourages common development techniques and patterns (more below).</li>
</ul>
