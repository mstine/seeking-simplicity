  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let me set the stage for you. I&#8217;m driving home happily listening to Ted Neward discuss the merits of Scala on the Javaworld podcast. As I pull into the driveway I see my wife waving frantically in the window. As geek brain struggles to process this, home brain kicks into gear. She needs me in the house now! I jump out of the car and slam the door shut, leaving all of the belongings I typically carry in the house.</p>

<p>I enter the house to find that a wasp has some how gotten in and is terrorizing the family. What ensues is roughly 15 minutes of wasp hunting. Wasp dead - end of story. Or so I thought.</p>

<p>As I&#8217;m driving my iPod (attached to the iTrip FM transmitter/charger) typically sits in my lap (for some reason I get the least FM interference that way). What I didn&#8217;t notice in my hasty departure from the vehicle is that my iPod nano flew out of the vehicle and was hanging by the iTrip cable. Unaware of this, I slammed the door on the cable and walked away.</p>

<p>This in and of itself wasn&#8217;t a huge problem. Leaving it that way for approximately 24 hours - most of which included rather steady rainfall - was.</p>

<p>So, a quick Google search finds that the consensus approach seems to be sticking the iPod in a cup of dry rice to soak up the moisture. So there you have it - my iPod is on rice. I hope it works. Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;since I actively spent any time blogging. What you don&#8217;t know is that it has been a long time since I&#8217;ve done any writing whatsoever. The last two posts on this blog revolved around the birth of my first son, Grant Dawson, on May 16, 2009. This was one of several events that took place almost a year ago that sent me directly into a whirlwind of activity that found me barely keeping my head above water.</p>

<p>It was also about this time that I found myself newly promoted into front-line management. The team that I entered first in 2000 as a Bioinformatics Intern during my last summer as an undergraduate, and then as a Software Engineer/Web Developer I following graduation in 2001, was now mine to lead. After doing this job now for nearly a year, I can safely say that my career as a developer has both prepared me for this role and left me completely bankrupt when faced with the responsibilities that are now mine. More on this to come.</p>

<p>Another event that transpired in May was the sale of our first home. It had been on the market since March, and we &#8220;paused&#8221; the showings as Grant&#8217;s arrival became imminent. It was near the end of May that we received both our first and our last post-Grant showing phone call. I remarked to Wendy - &#8220;these folks are going to buy the house.&#8221; And buy it they did. Unfortunately for us, we had no idea whatsoever where we were going to move. What ensued was a chaotic whirlwind of house hunting which ended with us making an offer on a house that wasn&#8217;t even on the market. And that&#8217;s the house I&#8217;m sitting in while I write this first entry of 2009. Ask me to tell you the story sometime - it&#8217;s a good one.</p>

<p>So, why I&#8217;m I here? Why not just leave the blogging task. After all, isn&#8217;t blogging passe at this point?</p>

<p>I credit my return to the blogosphere to an incredible book by Jared Richardson and Matthew Bass - <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/5925115">Career 2.0: Take Control of Your Life</a>. The basic premise of this book is to &#8220;Actively manage your career.&#8221; One of the ways by which the authors share how to do this is writing - sharing what you know with the community at-large. Of course what they shared was no surprise to me. I already knew all too well the career benefits associated with blogging. What I needed was a proverbial &#8220;kick in the pants.&#8221; And that&#8217;s what Career 2.0 did for me. If you&#8217;re in the software industry - take that back, I don&#8217;t care what industry you&#8217;re in (these principles are transcendent) - do yourself a favor and read this book. It will change something about your life, guaranteed.</p>

<p>So, with that, let&#8217;s start the conversation again. I&#8217;m looking forward to where it might lead. Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I haven&#8217;t blogged in quite awhile. I&#8217;ve been rather busy - here&#8217;s one VERY important reason why. Grant was born Friday, May 16, 2008, weighing in at 9 pounds 4 ounces and 22 inches long. Mom and baby are doing wonderfully, but as you can see, Dad is in a bit of shock!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;re taking most of our team to the St. Louis, Missouri, edition of the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> 2008 tour. This will be my first actual NFJS event. I attended the <a href="http://www.thespringexperience.com">Spring Experience</a> in 2007, which was put on by the NFJS guys, so I expect this event in St. Louis to be great. Since we&#8217;re based in Memphis, St. Louis is only about a 4 1/2 hour drive. We&#8217;re all going to pile in a van and road trip. It should be a great time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to have a hard time choosing sessions: Neal Ford, Scott Davis, David Geary, Jeff Brown, and Bryan Sletten all have sessions that I&#8217;d like to attend, several of which are in conflict. I hope they do post-conference video delivery of these sessions just like they&#8217;re doing for the Spring Experience.</p>

<p>If anyone&#8217;s going to be there, let&#8217;s do dinner one night and you can meet some of the St. Jude team.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So yesterday I was attempting to debug an issue in a batch processing module within one of our applications. In short, an assertion was failing deep within Hibernate as it attempted to flush the session. Using a combination of various log statements, I had isolated the problem down to a particular record that the batch process was attempting to update. (BTW: I know you shouldn&#8217;t be using Hibernate for batch processing - however, we&#8217;re talking about batches of at most 1000 records here, not millions!) What I really wanted to do was set a breakpoint and examine the state of the objects at runtime; however, I dreaded the thought of clicking through the breakpoint time and time again until I got to the particular record that was causing the problem. &#8220;Surely,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;there must be a way to tell the debugger to only break under certain conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, here&#8217;s the code I wanted to examine:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;public Publication parsePublication(String inputLine)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;   throws ParseException {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;       Publication publication = new Publication();&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;       String[] fields = inputLine.split("\t");&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;       publication.setPublicationType(fields[0]);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;       ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;       return publication;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, I wanted to break after <code>inputLine.split("\t");</code> if and only if <code>fields[35]</code> existed and was equal to &#8220;PM:16732581.&#8221; After examining IDEA&#8217;s Breakpoint dialog, I noticed a section in the bottom right-hand corner that I&#8217;d never played with before:</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Vo63LRwAZbk/R6idFtXVh2I/AAAAAAAAAcw/DpuaZ5TQUCs/s1600-h/breakpoint_dialog.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Vo63LRwAZbk/R6idFtXVh2I/AAAAAAAAAcw/DpuaZ5TQUCs/s320/breakpoint_dialog.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>As it turns out, this is exactly what I needed. If you click on the ellipsis next to the drop menu, you get a context-sensitive editor equipped with code completion:</p>

<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Vo63LRwAZbk/R6idb9XVh3I/AAAAAAAAAc4/MENimxICxyk/s1600-h/condition_dialog2.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Vo63LRwAZbk/R6idb9XVh3I/AAAAAAAAAc4/MENimxICxyk/s400/condition_dialog2.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Enter the desired conditions and voila! A conditional breakpoint. It worked like a charm the very first time, and I only had to inspect the breakpoint when the problematic record came up.</p>

<p>Another nice feature of the conditional breakpoint is that if some sort of exception (such as a NullPointerException) occurs while attempting to evaluate the conditional expression, IDEA pops up a dialog informing you what happened and asking if you want to stop at the breakpoint or continue. Nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came across a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/">link</a> today that would allow you to post &#8220;pretty&#8221; code in any HTML page. I&#8217;ve had plenty of problems (as have others) posting well-formatted source code to my Blogger-based blog. I&#8217;ve wanted to correct this problem for some time, and this project appears to be a decent solution. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>

<pre><code>function chooseWinner() {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;   $('p3').removeClassName('winner');&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;   participantBo.chooseWinnerForEvent(eventId, function(data) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;      people = $A(data);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;      updateDivs();&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;      intervalId = setInterval(doShift, 500);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;   });&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that isn&#8217;t too bad is it? There seems to be a bit of a delay as the Javascript is loaded, but I think that&#8217;s more a symptom of my connection than it is a problem with the script.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how you can take advantage of this solution (quoted from <a href="http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.html">http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.html</a>):</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/files/prettify-small.zip">Download</a> a distribution</p></li>
<li><p>Include the script and stylesheets in your document<br/>
  (you will need to make sure the css and js file are on your server, and<br/>
   adjust the paths in the script and link tag)</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>&lt;link href="prettify.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="prettify.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>Add <code>onload="prettyPrint()"</code> to your<br/>
document&#8217;s body tag.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the stylesheet to get the coloring you prefer</p></li>
<li><p>Put code snippets in<br/>
<pre class="prettyprint">...</pre><br/>
or <code class="prettyprint">...</code><br/>
and it will automatically be pretty printed.</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got an awesome email today&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>We are happy to announce that the video/audio streaming from TSE 2007 will be available online the week of February 11th for you.  You will have the opportunity to see/hear the TSE 2007 presentations you were not able to make at TSE 2007 due to all of the great sessions available per time period.  We have captured the entire session length including any demos/live coding.  Please look for the email from us next Monday, February 11th with the details about viewing the session content online.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m extremely excited about this. For two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I didn&#8217;t get to finish my reviews of the sessions that I attended. Now that it has been several weeks since the conference, I don&#8217;t feel like my memory of them is good enough to do a fair review. Now I can do a refresh and write!</li>
<li>There were several sessions that I wanted to attend that I couldn&#8217;t - now I get to attend&#8230;and write!
Look forward to some more reviews from The Spring Experience 2007 in the coming weeks!</li>
</ol>
