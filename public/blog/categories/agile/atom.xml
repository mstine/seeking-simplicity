    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been really quiet on this blog lately. There have been multiple reasons for that. I've been extremely busy preparing for conferences this Fall including SpringOne/2GX and The Rich Web Experience. I've also stayed busy writing for DZone. I have my first DZone Refcard coming out soon, which is focused on Web Driver/Selenium 2. I've also been writing my regular articles for Agile Zone. Here's a roundup:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In late September I completed an eight-part article series for Agile Zone entitled "The Seven Wastes of Software Development." This series discussed Mary and Tom Poppendieck's mapping of Shigeo Shingo's "Seven Wastes of Lean Manufacturing" into the software development world. This has been a very popular series, having been viewed a total of 57,887 times at this writing. Here's a set of links to the series:</p>
