    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the great things about Cloud Foundry is that it is a great enabler. Tall words. But what do they mean? Essentially, Cloud Foundry (and any other well-designed PaaS) enables us to do things as developers and operators that would be extremely difficult in a traditional deployment environments. One particularly valuable area of enablement is our new found ability to practice <a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/">Continous Delivery</a>, meaning that we continuously prove our ability to deliver working software by continuously treating each code commit to a system as if it could be deployed to a production environment. We do this by shipping these commits through what's called a "deployment pipeline," which consists of a series of build-test-deploy cycles that prove out a commit's suitability for production deployment. At the end of the pipeline we can either deploy automatically to our production environment (i.e. continuous deployment), or we can have a business decision to deploy that "deployable artifact" or not.</p>

<p>One particular practice associated with Continuous Delivery is <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html">Blue-Green Deployments</a>. Martin Fowler describes these very well at the link provided, but I'll summarize briefly here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cut-over to a new software version is tricky, and must be quick in order to minimize downtime events.</li>
<li>Blue-green deployments ensure the parallel existence of two, identical (as possible) production environments.</li>
<li>At any given point, only one (e.g. blue) services production traffic.</li>
<li>New deploys are made to the other (e.g. green) environment. Final smoke testing is performed here.</li>
<li>When green is determined ready, we begin routing traffic to it.</li>
<li>We then stop routing traffic to blue.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, there are several concerns that must be dealt with at the application level in order for this to work (datastores should support concurrent usage by two app versions, long running requests may be killed, etc.). What we'll focus on in this post is how Cloud Foundry supports the mechanics summarized above.</p>

<p>We'll begin with a basic Spring application named <code>ms-spr-demo</code>. This app takes users to a simple web page announcing the ubiquitous "Hello World!" message. We'll utilize the <code>cf</code> command-line interface to push the application:</p>

<p>``` bash
$ cf push --path build/libs/cf-demo.war
Name> ms-spr-demo</p>

<p>Instances> 1</p>

<p>Memory Limit> 512M</p>

<p>Creating ms-spr-demo... OK</p>

```</p>

<p>The end result of this <code>cf push</code> event is that an application is now serving requests at <code>http://ms-spr-demo.cfapps.io</code>. The following graphic shows the state of our system, with the CF Router sending traffic to our application:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blue-green/BlueGreen1.png"></p>

<p>Next, we make a slight change to our application. Rather that saying "Hello World!" we decide to make it say "Goodbye World!" We build a new war file for the application. Rather than letting <code>cf</code> prompt us this time, we'll make use of the <code>manifest.yml</code> file that we saved from our previous push. However, we'll rename the application and provide a new route. Take a look:</p>

<h2>``` </h2>

<p>applications:
- name: ms-spr-demo-green
  memory: 512M
  instances: 1
  url: ms-spr-demo-green.cfapps.io
  path: build/libs/cf-demo.war
```</p>

<p>As you can see, we're calling our new application version <code>ms-spr-demo-green</code> and we're mapping it to the URL <code>ms-spr-demo-green.cfapps.io</code>. Let's push the application:</p>

<p>``` bash
Using manifest file manifest.yml</p>

<p>Creating ms-spr-demo-green... OK</p>

<p>1: ms-spr-demo-green
2: none
Subdomain> ms-spr-demo-green</p>

```</p>

<p>We now have two instances of the application running, each of them using distinct routes:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blue-green/BlueGreen2.png"></p>

<p>Now it's time for the magic to happen. We'll map our original URL route (<code>ms-spr-demo.cfapps.io</code>) to our "green" instance. This is accomplished very simply by using <code>cf</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
cf map --app ms-spr-demo-green --host ms-spr-demo --domain cfapps.io
Binding ms-spr-demo.cfapps.io to ms-spr-demo-green... OK
</code></p>

<p>The CF router immediately begins to load balance requests between each instance of the application, as shown here:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blue-green/BlueGreen3.png"></p>

<p>Now our router will send requests to <code>ms-spr-demo.cfapps.io</code> to both instances of the application, while <code>ms-spr-demo-green.cfapps.io</code> only services the "green" instance. Once we determine that all is well, it's time to stop routing requests to the "blue" instance. This is just as simple using <code>cf</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
cf unmap --url ms-spr-demo.cfapps.io --app ms-spr-demo
Unbinding ms-spr-demo.cfapps.io from ms-spr-demo... OK
</code></p>

<p>Our "blue" instance is now no longer receiving any web traffic:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blue-green/BlueGreen4.png"></p>

<p>We can now decomission our "blue" instance, or we can leave it around for a period of time in case we decide we need to roll back our changes. The important thing is that our customers suffered absolutely no downtime!</p>

    <link href="http://mattstine.com/2013/05/29/clojure-on-cloud-foundry/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-29T22:10:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattstine.com/2013/05/29/clojure-on-cloud-foundry</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was inspired by Brian McClain's <a href="http://catdevrandom.me/blog/2013/05/16/buildpacks-in-cloud-foundry-v2/">post on bringing Haskell to Cloud Foundry</a> using Cloud Foundry v2 buildpacks, so I decided to go on a buildpack journey of my own. Since Clojure is the language I most enjoying "toying around with," I thought I'd try to deploy a simple Clojure web application using the <a href="https://github.com/mstine/heroku-buildpack-clojure">Heroku Clojure Buildpack</a>.</p>

<p>To reiterate some of the coolness around buildpacks, they are what allows a PaaS like Cloud Foundry or Heroku to support various runtimes without first building that support into the core platform. If your favorite language or framework runtime isn't available, there's absolutely nothing stopping you from providing your own buildpack to support it. Stuff can get crazy -- McClain has even <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianMMcClain/status/339479905974751232">hinted at bringing FORTRAN support to Cloud Foundry</a>.</p>

<p>I decided for my experiment to build a VERY basic "Hello World" style application using <a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a>, which is "a Clojure web applications library inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack." The easiest way to get started building Ring applications is to utilize the popular Clojure build tool <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a>.</p>

<p>First I started by creating a new project:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ lein new hello-cf
$ cd hello-cf
</code></p>

<p>The next task was to add the Ring dependencies to my <code>project.clj</code> file:</p>

<p>``` clojure
(defproject hello-cf "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :min-lein-version "2.0.0"
  :description "Hello Clojure on Cloud Foundry!"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"</p>

<pre><code>        :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
</code></pre>

<p>  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.4.0"]</p>

<pre><code>             [ring/ring-core "1.1.8"]
             [ring/ring-jetty-adapter "1.1.8"]])
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Then it was time to create the Ring application itself, by editing <code>src/hello_cf/core.clj</code>:</p>

<p>``` clojure
(ns hello-cf.core
  (:use [ring.adapter.jetty :only [run-jetty]]))</p>

<p>(defn handler [request]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
   :body "Hello Cloud Foundry from heroku-buildpack-clojure!"})</p>

<p>(defn -main [port]
  (run-jetty handler {:port (Integer. port)}))
```</p>

<p>Let's break this down a bit. The <code>handler</code> function will handle any HTTP request that hits our application, and will return an "OK" response containing a pleasant message indicating that we've succeeded. That's really about it. Our application is complete. We can test it out by running the following:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ lein trampoline run -m hello-cf.core 8080
2013-05-29 22:42:52.576:INFO:oejs.Server:jetty-7.6.1.v20120215
2013-05-29 22:42:52.804:INFO:oejs.AbstractConnector:Started SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:8080
</code></p>

<p>Hitting <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in the browser confirms that we're well on our way. Now it's time to trying pushing the application to Cloud Foundry. As Brian stated in his blog, one of the stellar aspects of Cloud Foundry buildpacks is that they are approximately the same as Heroku buildpacks. Practically, this means that one <em>should</em> be able to utilize a Heroku buildpack on Cloud Foundry with minimal or no modifications. Let's put that theory to the test, shall we? Before we do, let's create a <code>Procfile</code> quickly to let the buildpack know what we want to run:</p>

<p><code>
web: lein with-profile production trampoline run -m hello-cf.core $PORT
</code></p>

<p>And on with the push:</p>

<p>``` bash
cf push hello-cf --buildpack=git://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-clojure.git
Using manifest file manifest.yml</p>

<p>Creating hello-cf... OK</p>

<p>1: hello-cf
2: none
Subdomain> hello-cf</p>

<p>1: mstine.cf-app.com
2: none

<p>Drat. Let's take a quick look at the logs to see what may be awry:</p>

<p><code>bash

</code></p>

<p>Ah-hah! Looks like the existing buildpack is making some assumptions about the structure of our application that no longer hold true on Cloud Foundry. So, I followed in Brian's footsteps and <a href="https://github.com/mstine/heroku-buildpack-clojure">forked away</a>. One small <a href="https://github.com/mstine/heroku-buildpack-clojure/commit/fd2c46cc23267fa2d808123d2fd58f4295da4b85">commit</a> looks like it ought to fix the problem.

<p>Score another win for Cloud Foundry's buildpack support. I'm now toying with the idea of doing something of a world tour of LISP on Cloud Foundry. My next candidate may be <a href="https://github.com/evhan/heroku-buildpack-chicken">Scheme</a>.</p>

    <id>http://mattstine.com/2013/05/29/into-the-crucible</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow...it seems I only post to this blog toward the end of May. Well, that all changes now. You see, as of June 3, 2013, this blog is going to become one of many aspects of my new "day job." On Monday, I start my life as a Community Engineer with <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com">Cloud Foundry</a> by <a href="http://goPivotal.com">Pivotal</a>. What's a Community Engineer? Quite honestly, I'm not completely sure of the answer to that question yet. But given the many conversations I've had over the past few weeks, it seemingly fits right in with the bridge-building roles I've played many times over the course of my career. In this case, I have one foot squarely planted in the world of Cloud Foundry engineering, and one foot squarely planted out in the world with you guys and gals - the community. My job is to help you understand how we are quite literally seeking to "build a new platform for a new era."</p>

<p>Of course, this is a journey that for me started a few years ago. In my previous life as a front-line development manager, I helped lead an agile transformation within my team with "ruthless automation" playing a central role in everything that our team did. However, it seemed that the better we "did agile," the more pain we felt when dealing with those outside of our circle of control. It was only years later, after reading Eliyahu Goldratt's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)">The Goal</a> and coming to an understanding of his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Constraints">Theory of Constraints</a>, that I realized what was happening. Our constraints had moved "out of the plant," if you will, and landed in the world of operations. Even without this understanding, I developed a keen interest in this newly emerging topic called "DevOps" and began to explore the ideas emerging around agile operations and infrastructure as code. I started playing with tools like Puppet, Chef, and Vagrant, and taught sessions on all three of them at the Project Automation Experience in 2011.</p>

<p>You can read my <a href="http://www.mattstine.com/2012/05/24/the-relaunch/">last entry</a> and find out that not much later I joined VMware as a Senior Consultant for its Cloud Application Platform. I was hired into that role based on my extensive background in enterprise Java and the Spring ecosystem, but it was nothing short of a staffing accident that I found myself thrust into a role on a virtualization platform provisioning team helping to build out a private self-service cloud! I was steadily getting carried further away from my role as an application architect, steadily becoming assimilated into that mysterious world of web operations that I knew so little about. These experiences, along with my continued reading and thinking about the worlds of DevOps, Lean, and Kanban, have quite literally changed the way I look at the world of software engineering (or as I prefer to think of it now, value delivery through product engineering that just so happens to involve software!). These experiences have formed around me a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible">crucible</a>, melting me that I might be poured into a new professional mold.</p>

<p>So now it's time to plunge into the world of building the leading <a href="http://wattersjames.com/2013/03/04/my-fork-you-shirt/">open</a> platform as a service, and to help YOU experience the <a href="https://twitter.com/mstine/status/339570787914760195">HUGE can of @cloudfoundry awesome</a> that we at Pivotal are about to unleash on the world. Sound good to you? <a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/2013/05/16/want-to-contribute-to-cloud-foundry-come-on-in/">Join us!</a></p>
