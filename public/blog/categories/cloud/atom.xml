    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow...it seems I only post to this blog toward the end of May. Well, that all changes now. You see, as of June 3, 2013, this blog is going to become one of many aspects of my new "day job." On Monday, I start my life as a Community Engineer with <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com">Cloud Foundry</a> by <a href="http://goPivotal.com">Pivotal</a>. What's a Community Engineer? Quite honestly, I'm not completely sure of the answer to that question yet. But given the many conversations I've had over the past few weeks, it seemingly fits right in with the bridge-building roles I've played many times over the course of my career. In this case, I have one foot squarely planted in the world of Cloud Foundry engineering, and one foot squarely planted out in the world with you guys and gals - the community. My job is to help you understand how we are quite literally seeking to "build a new platform for a new era."</p>

<p>Of course, this is a journey that for me started a few years ago. In my previous life as a front-line development manager, I helped lead an agile transformation within my team with "ruthless automation" playing a central role in everything that our team did. However, it seemed that the better we "did agile," the more pain we felt when dealing with those outside of our circle of control. It was only years later, after reading Eliyahu Goldratt's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)">The Goal</a> and coming to an understanding of his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Constraints">Theory of Constraints</a>, that I realized what was happening. Our constraints had moved "out of the plant," if you will, and landed in the world of operations. Even without this understanding, I developed a keen interest in this newly emerging topic called "DevOps" and began to explore the ideas emerging around agile operations and infrastructure as code. I started playing with tools like Puppet, Chef, and Vagrant, and taught sessions on all three of them at the Project Automation Experience in 2011.</p>

<p>You can read my <a href="http://www.mattstine.com/2012/05/24/the-relaunch/">last entry</a> and find out that not much later I joined VMware as a Senior Consultant for its Cloud Application Platform. I was hired into that role based on my extensive background in enterprise Java and the Spring ecosystem, but it was nothing short of a staffing accident that I found myself thrust into a role on a virtualization platform provisioning team helping to build out a private self-service cloud! I was steadily getting carried further away from my role as an application architect, steadily becoming assimilated into that mysterious world of web operations that I knew so little about. These experiences, along with my continued reading and thinking about the worlds of DevOps, Lean, and Kanban, have quite literally changed the way I look at the world of software engineering (or as I prefer to think of it now, value delivery through product engineering that just so happens to involve software!). These experiences have formed around me a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible">crucible</a>, melting me that I might be poured into a new professional mold.</p>

<p>So now it's time to plunge into the world of building the leading <a href="http://wattersjames.com/2013/03/04/my-fork-you-shirt/">open</a> platform as a service, and to help YOU experience the <a href="https://twitter.com/mstine/status/339570787914760195">HUGE can of @cloudfoundry awesome</a> that we at Pivotal are about to unleash on the world. Sound good to you? <a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/2013/05/16/want-to-contribute-to-cloud-foundry-come-on-in/">Join us!</a></p>

    <updated>2010-05-28T09:21:43-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattstine.com/2010/05/28/announcing-nosql-summer-memphis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently stumbled across the <a href="http://nosqlsummer.org/">NOSQL Summer</a> website via my friend Alex Miller's <a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/2010/05/25/nosql-summer-st-louis/">blog</a>. The idea is to setup a summer reading club focused around databases and distributed systems. Groups will gather "worldwide" to discuss various papers and the hopefully submit the substance of their discussions back to the NOSQL Summer website in the form of annotated papers.</p>

<p>This sounded like a great idea to me, so I decided that we'd co-locate a NOSQL Summer discussion with our monthly Memphis JUG meetings. You can find the details of our NOSQL meetings at <a href="http://nosqlsummer.org/city/memphis">http://nosqlsummer.org/city/memphis</a>. We'll start at 5:30 and run until 6:15-6:30. If you're interested in these discussions, come on out to Southwest TN Community College on June 24th (even if you're not a Java type!).</p>

<p>Our first paper will be <a href="http://nosqlsummer.org/paper/end-of-architectural-era">The End of an Architectural Era (It's Time for a Complete Rewrite)</a>. Please read it before the meeting and come prepared to mindshare.</p>

<p>If there's enough interest in these discussions, we could start having a lunch time discussion at a centrally located restaurant halfway between each JUG meeting. We can discuss this at our first meeting in June. I hope to see you there!</p>

    <link href="http://mattstine.com/2009/06/01/deploying-grails-to-morph-appspace-communityone-2009-lightning-talk/"/>
    <updated>2009-06-01T23:56:06-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattstine.com/2009/06/01/deploying-grails-to-morph-appspace-communityone-2009-lightning-talk</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I gave two lightning talks at <a href="http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone/2009/west/index.jsp">CommunityOne</a> today, the first of which described deploying <a href="http://grails.org">Grails</a> applications to <a href="http://mor.ph/products_appspace">Morph AppSpace</a>.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, Grails is a Ruby on Rails inspired full stack web development framework which brings "convention over configuration" and "DRY" into the Java web development arena. Unlike Rails, it is not an effort from scratch, but rather stands on the shoulders of proven giants in the Java world like the Spring framework and Hibernate. It does this using Groovy, the popular dynamic scripting language for the JVM, as a sort of "DSL for web development." Find it at <a href="http://grails.org">http://grails.org</a>.</p>

<p>Morph AppSpace on the other hand is a fully-configured and managed environment for hosting web applications, and currently supports Java, Grails, Rails, and PHP applications. It is a "platform as a service" (PaaS) provider that abstracts away the details of Amazon EC2 and S3 technologies. Systems architecture, backups, monitoring, failover, scalability - all of this is handled by Morph. You simply develop and deploy your application - Morph does the rest. Find it at <a href="http://mor.ph/products_appspace">http://mor.ph/products_appspace</a>.</p>

<p>So to get going, visit <a href="http://mor.ph">http://mor.ph</a> and sign up for a free developer account. Create yourself a Java application subscription, and pick your choice of database (MySQL or PostgreSQL). Create the database, and then download two very important files into the root directory of your Grails project: deployment.properties, which contains the metadata describing your application to the Morph AppSpace platform, and morph_deployer.jar, which contains the client API to the platform.</p>

<p>Next you'll need to install the <a href="http://grails.org/plugin/morph-deploy">Grails morph-deploy plugin</a>. If you're using Grails 1.1, you'll need to checkout <a href="https://svn.codehaus.org/grails-plugins/grails-morph-deploy/trunk/">the trunk version from SVN</a>, as the version in the plugin repository is not 1.1 ready. Install this plugin locally by running "grails install-plugin $PATH_TO_PLUGIN." Next, you'll need to edit DataSource.groovy to contain the following:</p>

<pre><code>production {
        dataSource {
            driverClassName = 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'
            dbCreate = "update"
            jndiName = "java:comp/env/jdbc/morph-ds"
            dialect = 'org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect'
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, run "grails war" to build the war file, and "grails deploy" to upload your application to the platform. Once the upload is complete, visit the management interface and check the logs to see that you've successfully deployed. Once it's finished, click on the link to your application. Happy Grails on the cloud!</p>

<p>Here's the screencast from my talk. Enjoy!</p>
