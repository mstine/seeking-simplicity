    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I completed an interest survey for a potential Selenium-focused conference several weeks ago, and I'm excited to let you know that the "powers that be" have decided that the conference is going to happen! I have already submitted my "Executable Specifications: Automating Your Requirements Document with Geb and Spock" talk as a potential session. Whether it makes the conference program or not, I plan on attending the event. Here are the details:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-selenium-20?oid=hom31797"><img src="http://mattstine.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/31797.png" alt="" /></a>Today DZone released my first Refcard: "<a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-selenium-20?oid=hom31797">Selenium 2.0: Using the WebDriver API to Create Robust User Acceptance Tests</a>." I have been interested in writing a Refcard for a long time but have never pulled the trigger. For whatever reason, I decided to jump on the bandwagon last month. Writing this card was quite a challenge, as it's difficult to boil down a big topic into only six pages while keeping it useful. Thus far the feedback from the community has been largely positive.</p>

<p>If you're looking for your next automated testing tool for browser-based user acceptance tests, download the card and let me know what you think!</p>
