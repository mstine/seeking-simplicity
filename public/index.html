  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the great things about Cloud Foundry is that it is a great enabler. Tall words. But what do they mean? Essentially, Cloud Foundry (and any other well-designed PaaS) enables us to do things as developers and operators that would be extremely difficult in a traditional deployment environments. One particularly valuable area of enablement is our new found ability to practice <a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/">Continous Delivery</a>, meaning that we continuously prove our ability to deliver working software by continuously treating each code commit to a system as if it could be deployed to a production environment. We do this by shipping these commits through what&#8217;s called a &#8220;deployment pipeline,&#8221; which consists of a series of build-test-deploy cycles that prove out a commit&#8217;s suitability for production deployment. At the end of the pipeline we can either deploy automatically to our production environment (i.e. continuous deployment), or we can have a business decision to deploy that &#8220;deployable artifact&#8221; or not.</p>

<p>One particular practice associated with Continuous Delivery is <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html">Blue-Green Deployments</a>. Martin Fowler describes these very well at the link provided, but I&#8217;ll summarize briefly here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cut-over to a new software version is tricky, and must be quick in order to minimize downtime events.</li>
<li>Blue-green deployments ensure the parallel existence of two, identical (as possible) production environments.</li>
<li>At any given point, only one (e.g. blue) services production traffic.</li>
<li>New deploys are made to the other (e.g. green) environment. Final smoke testing is performed here.</li>
<li>When green is determined ready, we begin routing traffic to it.</li>
<li>We then stop routing traffic to blue.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, there are several concerns that must be dealt with at the application level in order for this to work (datastores should support concurrent usage by two app versions, long running requests may be killed, etc.). What we&#8217;ll focus on in this post is how Cloud Foundry supports the mechanics summarized above.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll begin with a basic Spring application named <code>ms-spr-demo</code>. This app takes users to a simple web page announcing the ubiquitous &#8220;Hello World!&#8221; message. We&#8217;ll utilize the <code>cf</code> command-line interface to push the application:</p>

<p>The end result of this <code>cf push</code> event is that an application is now serving requests at <code>http://ms-spr-demo.cfapps.io</code>. The following graphic shows the state of our system, with the CF Router sending traffic to our application:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blue-green/BlueGreen1.png"></p>

<p>Next, we make a slight change to our application. Rather that saying &#8220;Hello World!&#8221; we decide to make it say &#8220;Goodbye World!&#8221; We build a new war file for the application. Rather than letting <code>cf</code> prompt us this time, we&#8217;ll make use of the <code>manifest.yml</code> file that we saved from our previous push. However, we&#8217;ll rename the application and provide a new route. Take a look:</p>

<p>As you can see, we&#8217;re calling our new application version <code>ms-spr-demo-green</code> and we&#8217;re mapping it to the URL <code>ms-spr-demo-green.cfapps.io</code>. Let&#8217;s push the application:</p>

<p>We now have two instances of the application running, each of them using distinct routes:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blue-green/BlueGreen2.png"></p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s time for the magic to happen. We&#8217;ll map our original URL route (<code>ms-spr-demo.cfapps.io</code>) to our &#8220;green&#8221; instance. This is accomplished very simply by using <code>cf</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>cf map --app ms-spr-demo-green --host ms-spr-demo --domain cfapps.io
</span><span class='line'>Binding ms-spr-demo.cfapps.io to ms-spr-demo-green... OK
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The CF router immediately begins to load balance requests between each instance of the application, as shown here:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blue-green/BlueGreen3.png"></p>

<p>Now our router will send requests to <code>ms-spr-demo.cfapps.io</code> to both instances of the application, while <code>ms-spr-demo-green.cfapps.io</code> only services the &#8220;green&#8221; instance. Once we determine that all is well, it&#8217;s time to stop routing requests to the &#8220;blue&#8221; instance. This is just as simple using <code>cf</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>cf unmap --url ms-spr-demo.cfapps.io --app ms-spr-demo
</span><span class='line'>Unbinding ms-spr-demo.cfapps.io from ms-spr-demo... OK
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Our &#8220;blue&#8221; instance is now no longer receiving any web traffic:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blue-green/BlueGreen4.png"></p>

<p>We can now decomission our &#8220;blue&#8221; instance, or we can leave it around for a period of time in case we decide we need to roll back our changes. The important thing is that our customers suffered absolutely no downtime!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was inspired by Brian McClain&#8217;s <a href="http://catdevrandom.me/blog/2013/05/16/buildpacks-in-cloud-foundry-v2/">post on bringing Haskell to Cloud Foundry</a> using Cloud Foundry v2 buildpacks, so I decided to go on a buildpack journey of my own. Since Clojure is the language I most enjoying &#8220;toying around with,&#8221; I thought I&#8217;d try to deploy a simple Clojure web application using the <a href="https://github.com/mstine/heroku-buildpack-clojure">Heroku Clojure Buildpack</a>.</p>

<p>To reiterate some of the coolness around buildpacks, they are what allows a PaaS like Cloud Foundry or Heroku to support various runtimes without first building that support into the core platform. If your favorite language or framework runtime isn&#8217;t available, there&#8217;s absolutely nothing stopping you from providing your own buildpack to support it. Stuff can get crazy &#8211; McClain has even <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianMMcClain/status/339479905974751232">hinted at bringing FORTRAN support to Cloud Foundry</a>.</p>

<p>I decided for my experiment to build a VERY basic &#8220;Hello World&#8221; style application using <a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a>, which is &#8220;a Clojure web applications library inspired by Python&#8217;s WSGI and Ruby&#8217;s Rack.&#8221; The easiest way to get started building Ring applications is to utilize the popular Clojure build tool <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a>.</p>

<p>First I started by creating a new project:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>lein new hello-cf
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>hello-cf
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>The next task was to add the Ring dependencies to my <code>project.clj</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defproject </span><span class="nv">hello-cf</span> <span class="s">&quot;0.1.0-SNAPSHOT&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">:min-lein-version</span> <span class="s">&quot;2.0.0&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">:description</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello Clojure on Cloud Foundry!&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">:license</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="s">&quot;Eclipse Public License&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="ss">:url</span> <span class="s">&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">:dependencies</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="nv">org.clojure/clojure</span> <span class="s">&quot;1.4.0&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>                 <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">ring/ring-core</span> <span class="s">&quot;1.1.8&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>                 <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">ring/ring-jetty-adapter</span> <span class="s">&quot;1.1.8&quot;</span><span class="p">]])</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then it was time to create the Ring application itself, by editing <code>src/hello_cf/core.clj</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">ns </span><span class="nv">hello-cf.core</span>

</span><span class='line'>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&#8217;s break this down a bit. The <code>handler</code> function will handle any HTTP request that hits our application, and will return an &#8220;OK&#8221; response containing a pleasant message indicating that we&#8217;ve succeeded. That&#8217;s really about it. Our application is complete. We can test it out by running the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>lein trampoline run -m hello-cf.core 8080
</span><span class='line'>2013-05-29 22:42:52.576:INFO:oejs.Server:jetty-7.6.1.v20120215
</span><span class='line'>2013-05-29 22:42:52.804:INFO:oejs.AbstractConnector:Started SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:8080
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Hitting <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in the browser confirms that we&#8217;re well on our way. Now it&#8217;s time to trying pushing the application to Cloud Foundry. As Brian stated in his blog, one of the stellar aspects of Cloud Foundry buildpacks is that they are approximately the same as Heroku buildpacks. Practically, this means that one <em>should</em> be able to utilize a Heroku buildpack on Cloud Foundry with minimal or no modifications. Let&#8217;s put that theory to the test, shall we? Before we do, let&#8217;s create a <code>Procfile</code> quickly to let the buildpack know what we want to run:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>web: lein with-profile production trampoline run -m hello-cf.core <span class="nv">$PORT</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And on with the push:</p>

<p>Drat. Let&#8217;s take a quick look at the logs to see what may be awry:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Ah-hah! Looks like the existing buildpack is making some assumptions about the structure of our application that no longer hold true on Cloud Foundry. So, I followed in Brian&#8217;s footsteps and <a href="https://github.com/mstine/heroku-buildpack-clojure">forked away</a>. One small <a href="https://github.com/mstine/heroku-buildpack-clojure/commit/fd2c46cc23267fa2d808123d2fd58f4295da4b85">commit</a> looks like it ought to fix the problem.

<p>BOOM!</p>

<p>I quickly pointed my browser, and as yesterday&#8217;s tweet indicates, success:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Score another win for Cloud Foundry&#8217;s buildpack support. I&#8217;m now toying with the idea of doing something of a world tour of LISP on Cloud Foundry. My next candidate may be <a href="https://github.com/evhan/heroku-buildpack-chicken">Scheme</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow&#8230;it seems I only post to this blog toward the end of May. Well, that all changes now. You see, as of June 3, 2013, this blog is going to become one of many aspects of my new &#8220;day job.&#8221; On Monday, I start my life as a Community Engineer with <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com">Cloud Foundry</a> by <a href="http://goPivotal.com">Pivotal</a>. What&#8217;s a Community Engineer? Quite honestly, I&#8217;m not completely sure of the answer to that question yet. But given the many conversations I&#8217;ve had over the past few weeks, it seemingly fits right in with the bridge-building roles I&#8217;ve played many times over the course of my career. In this case, I have one foot squarely planted in the world of Cloud Foundry engineering, and one foot squarely planted out in the world with you guys and gals - the community. My job is to help you understand how we are quite literally seeking to &#8220;build a new platform for a new era.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, this is a journey that for me started a few years ago. In my previous life as a front-line development manager, I helped lead an agile transformation within my team with &#8220;ruthless automation&#8221; playing a central role in everything that our team did. However, it seemed that the better we &#8220;did agile,&#8221; the more pain we felt when dealing with those outside of our circle of control. It was only years later, after reading Eliyahu Goldratt&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)">The Goal</a> and coming to an understanding of his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Constraints">Theory of Constraints</a>, that I realized what was happening. Our constraints had moved &#8220;out of the plant,&#8221; if you will, and landed in the world of operations. Even without this understanding, I developed a keen interest in this newly emerging topic called &#8220;DevOps&#8221; and began to explore the ideas emerging around agile operations and infrastructure as code. I started playing with tools like Puppet, Chef, and Vagrant, and taught sessions on all three of them at the Project Automation Experience in 2011.</p>

<p>You can read my <a href="http://www.mattstine.com/2012/05/24/the-relaunch/">last entry</a> and find out that not much later I joined VMware as a Senior Consultant for its Cloud Application Platform. I was hired into that role based on my extensive background in enterprise Java and the Spring ecosystem, but it was nothing short of a staffing accident that I found myself thrust into a role on a virtualization platform provisioning team helping to build out a private self-service cloud! I was steadily getting carried further away from my role as an application architect, steadily becoming assimilated into that mysterious world of web operations that I knew so little about. These experiences, along with my continued reading and thinking about the worlds of DevOps, Lean, and Kanban, have quite literally changed the way I look at the world of software engineering (or as I prefer to think of it now, value delivery through product engineering that just so happens to involve software!). These experiences have formed around me a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible">crucible</a>, melting me that I might be poured into a new professional mold.</p>

<p>So now it&#8217;s time to plunge into the world of building the leading <a href="http://wattersjames.com/2013/03/04/my-fork-you-shirt/">open</a> platform as a service, and to help YOU experience the <a href="https://twitter.com/mstine/status/339570787914760195">HUGE can of @cloudfoundry awesome</a> that we at Pivotal are about to unleash on the world. Sound good to you? <a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/2013/05/16/want-to-contribute-to-cloud-foundry-come-on-in/">Join us!</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have rebooted this blog many times over the last several years. If you&#8217;ve been a reader of my blog in the past, you will have noticed significant changes. If you&#8217;re new here, welcome!</p>

<p>This reboot has been in the works for several months now, even though I&#8217;ve probably spent far less than 24 active hours working on it. Life as an &#8220;itinerant&#8221; consultant and conference speaker is extremely busy compared to what I was doing on May 16, 2012 (the date of my last blog posting). At that time I was in the middle of a transition from 3+ years as a front-line manager of a software development team into a lead software architect role. Since that time I&#8217;ve changed jobs (careers?) twice:</p>

<ul>
<li>June 2011 - February 2012: During this time I was titled as a &#8220;Technical Architect&#8221; at AutoZone&#8217;s corporate offices in Memphis, TN. My focus was the modernization of their retail store management system architecture and technical stack. While there I also did a fair amount of agile coaching.</li>
<li>February 2012 - Present: In January, VMware came calling, wanting to know if I would join the vFabric Cloud Application Platform PSO as a Senior Consultant. After a few weeks of interviews and careful consideration, I made the jump. I&#8217;m now in the midst of helping a Fortune 50 company build a brand new &#8220;private cloud&#8221; hosting platform for their next generation of application development.</li>
</ul>


<p>During that time I also significantly increased my participation on the No Fluff Just Stuff tour. In other words, I&#8217;ve BEEN BUSY.</p>

<p>At any rate, I have for quite awhile now wanted to get back into the practice of writing. However, I&#8217;ve wanted to do so outside the constraints of a hosted platform like Blogger or WordPress.com. Those systems place far too many constraints on how your blog works, and they also happen to be the only place that your data is housed. Sure, I could write my posts in Vim and then copy/paste them into the platform, but that&#8217;s annoying. I wanted to manage my writing using a plain text editor, mark it up using something lightweight like Markdown, check my writing into version control using Git, generate my site using a tool like Jekyll, and then push my site to the cloud. What was the easiest way to achieve all of this goodness? <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> seemed to fit the bill.</p>

<p>So, what you now see is the result of my labor in migrating from WordPress.com to Octopress, hosted at Heroku. One day (perhaps) I&#8217;ll write up the process that I used. It was a bit convoluted and involved gigantic piles of yak hair, so I&#8217;d rather not consider that piece right now.</p>

<p>What I will be focusing on quite a bit is the idea of simplicity. For more than a decade I have wandered through the barren wasteland that is accidental complexity in software. A few months ago I viewed Rich Hickey’s <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/simple-made-easy">keynote session at StrangeLoop 2011</a> entitled <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">“Simple Made Easy”</a>. It is Rich’s definition of simplicity in software that has inspired the brand new title of this blog, wherein I will chronicle my continuing quest to seek out simplicity in software structure.</p>

<p>Alas, it is time to return to billable work. I shall endeavor to post again in far less than a year. So, as we say in the south, &#8220;Ya&#8217;ll come back now, you hear?&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of you that don&#8217;t know, I recently returned to the technical ranks as a Software Architect after a three-year stint in management. To make a long story short, I now love my job again. Perhaps I&#8217;ll write the long story in a future blog entry. On to the topic at hand. Today I led the first significant design discussion that I have led in quite a long time. A few minutes afterward, I was already reflecting on what had occurred and how. The very first thing that I noticed was my drastically different approach to the task. I felt that my facilitation skills were more mature and effective than I remember from previous similar engagements. I&#8217;m not sure if the time I spent in management (where I facilitated quite a few meetings, though much more business-focused ones) helped, but something certainly has.</p>

<p>I also noticed several things that I&#8217;ll call &#8220;pattern vs. antipattern&#8221; tugs of war. Quite often during the meeting I felt the group trying to move our discussion in one direction that I, for better or for worse, thought was ineffective. I would then redirect us on to what I felt was a better path. In true catalog form, here&#8217;s the list:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Understand the Problem vs. Jump to the Solution</strong> - only a couple of minutes into our discussion solutions were being flung about like drunken darts. This situation almost always leads to suboptimal or faulty solutions. As a facilitator, try to ensure that the problem has been clearly stated. If at all possible, write it down on a whiteboard. Make sure everyone agrees that the problem as stated is the problem the group is there to solve. Sure enough, after performing this exercise, we all had a very different and clear understanding of the problem than that with which we walked in the door.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assume the Worst vs. Assume the Best</strong> - occasionally the exact details of a requirement are unclear, and not assuming something will totally derail the design discussion. You have a couple of choices. The first is to halt the discussion and get the details cleared up. This is clearly the best solution, as you&#8217;ll no longer have to assume anything. However, it can be the case that the person who can clear things up isn&#8217;t available. Or in some cases, the question you&#8217;ll be asking will require another meeting at another level of the organization. If you find yourself in that spot, and you can&#8217;t wait (we couldn&#8217;t!), then the best approach is to work from the worst possible case scenario. You&#8217;ll then be in the best position to handle whatever answer comes your way. However, our tendency is often to assume the best (&#8220;That will <em>never</em> happen!&#8221;). Fight that tendency. However, whatever you choose, follow up at your earliest opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Basing Decisions on the Current Situation vs. Basing Decisions on History</strong> - many times the group wanted to veer off into safer territory. In some cases, a possible solution departed significantly from the current design. While this is a valid concern (we do want consistency of design across the system where possible), it is certainly not a trump card. Occasionally the situation at hand will merit a significant departure from the current design. Another way history can rear its ugly head is the assertion that we&#8217;ve always solved similar problems like &#8216;x,&#8217; so we should do so with this problem as well. Again, note the word &#8220;similar.&#8221; All problems are somewhat different and have their own eccentricities. So, rather than working from history, I pushed us back to a clean slate with the statement &#8220;Let&#8217;s stop thinking about the past and start from scratch. We may very well come up with the same solution you guys are proposing, but I&#8217;d rather do so through our own objective analysis and not instinct.&#8221; Guess what. We came up with a different solution that we all felt better about.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shooting for the &#8220;Best&#8221; Solution vs. the &#8220;Easiest&#8221; Solution</strong> - now sometimes we can&#8217;t afford the best solution. I grant that. However, I&#8217;m trying to fight the tendency to immediately jump to the &#8220;easiest thing that could possibly work.&#8221; Often this pops up in the first P vs. AP - if we don&#8217;t clearly understand the problem, sometimes an easy solution jumps out that doesn&#8217;t deal with the underlying details we&#8217;ve yet to uncover. Also, sometimes the best solution is quite simple and elegant. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be harder and more complex than the easiest solution. In fact, sometimes the &#8220;easiest&#8221; solution leads to the most accidental complexity in the long-run. So, shoot for the best solution you can come up with and only then, optimize for cost.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Present Possible Solutions Objectively vs. My Solution is the Best!</strong> - one would hope that we all start here, but we don&#8217;t. We tend to like our own solutions to problems and want them to &#8220;win.&#8221; Our ego can get in the way of even hearing an alternate solution presented by another team member. I point you to <a href="http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=1105121">my colleague Ted Neward&#8217;s post for more on &#8220;egoless programming.&#8221;</a> So, as a facilitator, you&#8217;ve got to make sure that all solutions are presented objectively. I often had to say things like &#8220;OK, let&#8217;s assume before we ever get started that this is a good solution to the problem and not hack away at it until its fully presented, and we all understand it.&#8221; In the end, this insistence led us to choose a solution that none of us (myself included) originally thought we&#8217;d pick.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Validating from Code vs. Validating from Memory</strong> - more often than not, questions about the existing design/code/behavior will come up. Rather than scratching your head and trying to remember what you wrote six months ago, pull up the code and find out. I can&#8217;t tell you the number of meetings I&#8217;ve attended where baseless assertions were made about existing code, only to require another meeting the next day to revisit the whole discussion once those assertions were proven wrong. Again, as a facilitator, I directed us to solve every problem for which all of the facts were available. We inserted placeholders in our solution where questions remained. Guess what we&#8217;re doing now? Well, I&#8217;m blogging about the meeting, but the rest of us are validating from code. Tomorrow will fill in the blanks!</p></li>
</ul>

For whatever reason, I decided to jump on the bandwagon last month. Writing this card was quite a challenge, as it&#8217;s difficult to boil down a big topic into only six pages while keeping it useful. Thus far the feedback from the community has been largely positive.</p>
