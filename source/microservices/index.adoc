Given the huge amount of buzz around Microservices right now, as well as the huge amount of content being generated, I thought I'd begin curating a ``Microservices Reading List.''
With that said, the main reason for the creation of this page is the continual question: ``Great talk/article/etc. Where can I learn more?''

Below you'll find articles, blogs, videos, slide decks, etc.
I'm going to try to categorize them a bit as well.
This is by no means a complete catalog. Continue to check back for updates!

== Start Here

* http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html[Microservices]: overview by James Shore and Martin Fowler

== It's Not All Roses...

Here you'll find posts acknowledging the challenges associated with Microservices:

* http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/4/8/microservices-not-a-free-lunch.html[Microservices - Not A Free Lunch!]
* https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/microservices-and-the-failure-of-encapsulaton[Microservices and the Failure of Encapsulation] - interesting opinion piece

== Field Reports

Enough with the theory.

== Organization/Process/Governance

Microservices is far from being only a technical architecture pattern. There are huge issues associated with culture, team organization, process, data ownership, governance, etc.
Here are some relevant pieces:

== Antifragile

My new friend Russ Miles is deep into Microservices. He's primarily focused on the meme of _antifragility_ in software. Here's some of his stuff:
