Given the huge amount of buzz around Microservices right now, as well as the huge amount of content being generated, I thought I'd begin curating a ``Microservices Reading List.''
With that said, the main reason for the creation of this page is the continual question: ``Great talk/article/etc. Where can I learn more?''

Below you'll find articles, blogs, videos, slide decks, etc.
I'm going to try to categorize them a bit as well.
This is by no means a complete catalog. Continue to check back for updates!

== Start Here

* http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html[Microservices]: overview by James Shore and Martin Fowler

== It's Not All Roses...

Here you'll find posts acknowledging the challenges associated with Microservices:

* http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/4/8/microservices-not-a-free-lunch.html[Microservices - Not A Free Lunch!]
* https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/microservices-and-the-failure-of-encapsulaton[Microservices and the Failure of Encapsulation] - interesting opinion piece

== Field Reports

Enough with the theory.
Who's doing this?

== It's Not About Size

Don't get caught up in the *micro* of Microservices:

* http://www.tigerteam.dk/2014/micro-services-its-not-only-the-size-that-matters-its-also-how-you-use-them-part-1/[Micro services: It’s not (only) the size that matters, it’s (also) how you use them – part 1]

== Organization/Process/Governance

Microservices is far from being only a technical architecture pattern. There are huge issues associated with culture, team organization, process, data ownership, governance, etc.
Here are some relevant pieces:

* https://blog.apigee.com/detail/api_centric_architecture_services_governance_does_not_scale[API-Centric Architecture: Services Governance Does Not Scale]

== Antifragile

My new friend Russ Miles is deep into Microservices. He's primarily focused on the meme of _antifragility_ in software. Here's some of his stuff:

Building Adaptable Software with Microservices] - eBook in progress
* http://www.infoq.com/articles/russ-miles-antifragility-microservices[Russ Miles on Antifragility and Microservices] - InfoQ Interview

== Useful Architectural Patterns

A lot of patterns are cropping up in the microservices space, many of which are described very well on Martin Fowler's site:

== Netflix!

Netflix is well known for employing microservices and talking about it. Here are several technical blogs that touch the subject in various ways:

* http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/02/fault-tolerance-in-high-volume.html[Fault Tolerance in a High Volume, Distributed System]
* http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/embracing-differences-inside-netflix.html[Embracing the Differences : Inside the Netflix API Redesign]
