I am the Group Leader of Research Application Development at St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital in Memphis, TN. For the last decade I'ved been developing and supporting enterprise Java applications in support of life sciences research. I speak frequently on the No Fluff Just Stuff symposium series tour, as well as at other conferences such as JavaOne, SpringOne/2GX, The Rich Web Experience, and The Project Automation Experience. I have served as Agile Zone Leader for DZone, and my articles also appear in GroovyMag and NFJS the Magazine. I am also author of the Selenium 2.0 DZone Refcard. When I'm not on the road, I also enjoys my role as President of the Memphis/Mid-South Java User Group. My current areas of interest include lean/agile software development, modular software architecture, object-oriented design, functional programming, automated testing of modern web applications, and NoSQL datastores.





When I'm not working, I primarily spend my time trying to keep four very important girls happy: my sweet wife Wendy and my three daughters Abby, Isabella, and Ali Kate:
