[![](http://mattstine.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/31797.png)](http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-selenium-20?oid=hom31797)Today DZone released my first Refcard: "[Selenium 2.0: Using the WebDriver API to Create Robust User Acceptance Tests](http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-selenium-20?oid=hom31797)." I have been interested in writing a Refcard for a long time but have never pulled the trigger. For whatever reason, I decided to jump on the bandwagon last month. Writing this card was quite a challenge, as it's difficult to boil down a big topic into only six pages while keeping it useful. Thus far the feedback from the community has been largely positive. 

If you're looking for your next automated testing tool for browser-based user acceptance tests, download the card and let me know what you think!
