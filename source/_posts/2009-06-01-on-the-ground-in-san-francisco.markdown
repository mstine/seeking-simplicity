...for my second trip to JavaOne. This is going to be an extremely busy week.

Just as a quick update to those who thought I have fallen off of the face of the earth, I've been very busy these past few weeks finishing up a lot of loose ends. First off, May is a busy month for our family. With Mother's Day, Wendy's 30th Birthday, and Grant's 1st Birthday, we've been doing quite a lot as a family. Second, I've been scrambling to finish off Wendy's stationery store site, and I'm pleased to announce that [http://www.duckduckgoosedesigns.com](http://www.duckduckgoosedesigns.com) went into production on Memorial Day!

Last of all, I've been putting the finishing touches on my two lightning talks for Community One and my Java.net Community Corner podcast. In fact, I recorded the last demo video for my Google App Engine talk as I sat here in the Intercontinental Hotel.

At any rate, I've got a packed schedule ahead, full of technical sessions, BOF's, meetups, parties, etc. It's the ultimate geek vacation. Stay tuned as I blog my way through. You can also pickup my Twitter feed for up-to-the-minute news. ;-)
