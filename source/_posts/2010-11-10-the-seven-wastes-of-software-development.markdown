In late September I completed an eight-part article series for Agile Zone entitled "The Seven Wastes of Software Development." This series discussed Mary and Tom Poppendieck's mapping of Shigeo Shingo's "Seven Wastes of Lean Manufacturing" into the software development world. This has been a very popular series, having been viewed a total of 57,887 times at this writing. Here's a set of links to the series:
