This year, I'll be taking part in JDRF's Walk to Cure Diabetes, along with one-half million other walkers across the country, as we try to reach our goal of raising $90 million.  
  
Type 1, or juvenile, diabetes, is a devastating disease that affects millions of people - a large and growing percentage of them children. One of them is my oldest daughter, Abby, who is three years old.  
  
Since Abby's diagnosis, she's had her fingers pricked over 800 times already. She's received more than 200 shots in her arms, legs, and tummy. Over the course of her life, she'll continue to receive daily insulin injections and finger pricks. She must take insulin to stay alive. We must constantly monitor her glucose levels to ward off complications such as blindness, kidney failure, and stroke. Abby must maintain strict control of her diet every day (even on birthdays and holidays), check her blood sugar at least 6 times a day, and take insulin at least twice a day.  
  
There is some good news, though. For the first time, scientists are predicting that we CAN expect to see a cure well within our lifetime! This is exactly what we're wishing for, so we've formed a team called "Wishing With Abby," and we'd love to have your help.
