I've spent quite a bit of time playing with this [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org) thing.  It's amazing that I was able to build such a nice basic CRUD app w/ only 57 lines of code.  Now, I know this app didn't do much - just manage an Online Cookbook ([i.e. the OnLAMP.com Rolling on Rails tutorial](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html)).  I'm going to go through ["Four Days on Rails"](http://rails.homelinux.org/) next since it purports to be a tutorial with a "Real App."  I'm excited about maybe using Ruby for rapid prototyping for our enterprise-class Java apps...maybe even for production apps.  Who knows...Ruby may replace Java? :-)
