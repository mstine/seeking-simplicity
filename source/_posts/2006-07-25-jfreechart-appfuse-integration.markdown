I recently finished integrating [JFreeChart](http://http//www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) with AppFuse for a project I'm working on. JFreeChart is a really powerful Java chart library. If your application has any requirements for charts/graphs, I highly recommend it. The user manual and demo code come with a price tag ($39.95 for a single developer), but they are well worth the purchase - especially the demo code. If you don't have the $$$, the [support forum](http://www.jfree.org/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=3) is also very helpful.

I plan to put together a tutorial to help anyone interested in using JFreeChart in their AppFuse application. Look for it here and on the appfuse-user mailing list. It will be based on JSF since that's what I'm using right now.
