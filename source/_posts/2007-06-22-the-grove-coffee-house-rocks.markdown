It's Friday night, and what am I doing but coding. My wife's night out is spent at the scrapbook store working on her latest layouts - mine is at my new favorite coffee shop, working on open source. I discovered this place on a date with Wendy a couple of months ago. The nice thing about it is the distinctly Christian atmosphere. A good friend of mine and I meet here on Friday mornings for accountability. Well, since they hand out free wireless internet, I thought I'd drop by for my night out as well. Good coding atmosphere - I have a nice corner with a plugin for my laptop, so I'm good to go. Check this place out if you're in DeSoto County, MS or the Memphis metro area anytime soon - [http://grovecoffeehouse.com](http://grovecoffeehouse.com).
