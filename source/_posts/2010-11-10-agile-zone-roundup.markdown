I've been really quiet on this blog lately. There have been multiple reasons for that. I've been extremely busy preparing for conferences this Fall including SpringOne/2GX and The Rich Web Experience. I've also stayed busy writing for DZone. I have my first DZone Refcard coming out soon, which is focused on Web Driver/Selenium 2. I've also been writing my regular articles for Agile Zone. Here's a roundup:
