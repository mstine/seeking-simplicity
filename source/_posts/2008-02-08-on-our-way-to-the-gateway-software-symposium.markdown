We're taking most of our team to the St. Louis, Missouri, edition of the [No Fluff Just Stuff](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com) 2008 tour. This will be my first actual NFJS event. I attended the [Spring Experience](http://www.thespringexperience.com) in 2007, which was put on by the NFJS guys, so I expect this event in St. Louis to be great. Since we're based in Memphis, St. Louis is only about a 4 1/2 hour drive. We're all going to pile in a van and road trip. It should be a great time.   
  
I'm going to have a hard time choosing sessions: Neal Ford, Scott Davis, David Geary, Jeff Brown, and Bryan Sletten all have sessions that I'd like to attend, several of which are in conflict. I hope they do post-conference video delivery of these sessions just like they're doing for the Spring Experience.  
  
If anyone's going to be there, let's do dinner one night and you can meet some of the St. Jude team.
