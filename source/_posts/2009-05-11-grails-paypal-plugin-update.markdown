Since I last posted on [my fork of the Grails PayPal Plugin](http://www.mattstine.com/2009/05/02/ive-forked-the-grails-paypal-plugin/), I've been invited to be a committer on the [Grails Plugins project at the Codehaus](http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/grails-plugins). I'll be incorporating my changes into the SVN repository there and updating the documentation on the main Grails Plugins website. Look for these updates coming soon!!!
