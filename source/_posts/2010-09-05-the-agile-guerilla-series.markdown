I recently completed a series of articles for Agile Zone entitled "The Agile Guerilla." Those of you that have seen me on the No Fluff Just Stuff tour this year may recognize a talk by the same name. They are one and the same concept: my attempt to reach the masses with strategies for introducing change, specifically moving to agility, into organizations from the grassroots level.

Here's a list of the complete set of articles for your convenience!
