Yes, it's true. I came to the realization that there is such a thing as TADD...technology attention deficit disorder. Ironically, I came to this realization while reading a sample chapter from the upcoming book from the Prags, _Pomodoro Technique Illustrated: Can You Focus - Really Focus - for 25 Minutes?_ You see, it's Pragmatic Programmer Writing Month ([follow the trail that begins here](http://praglife.typepad.com/pragmatic_life/2009/10/prag-pro-wri-mo.html)), and I finally set aside an hour today to begin writing. At present, I just can't make up my mind what book topic I want to focus on. I have the following in mind:




  
  * Polyglot Programming

  
  * Agile Testing Strategies

  
  * Groovy/Grails Automated Testing

  
  * Functional Programming in a JVM World

  
  * Or, perhaps, a topic that hasn't churned up from my R-mode brain yet...



So, I have decided that I want to write an article detailing my development of [http://www.duckduckgoosedesigns.com](http://www.duckduckgoosedesigns.com) in Grails, an article that I hope will appear in an upcoming issue of Groovymag. It seemed like a good idea - write on something that I know very well and that I think could be helpful to others. Not only that, but it just might prime the writing pump for a bigger work like, maybe, a book! So, as I started writing, it occurred to me that I needed to let WebDevPub know that the entire source code for the online store was available at GitHub, so I jumped into the article submission site and added a note. This reminded me that I had not yet applied license headers to my source files, so I jumped into IDEA to use the Copyright Plugin to do so. It was at this point that I figured out that the Copyright Plugin does not support Groovy or GSP files, so I decided it would be a good idea to write a Grails script that would automatically do this. In the process, I decided to jump over to TweetDeck and let the world know of my intentions. It was at this point that I realized I had not yet followed @praglife on Twitter, so I fired that off. Realizing I wasn't quite sure of the @praglife Twitter handle, I jumped over to the blog, and while looking for it noticed the news item about the Pomodoro book. I clicked on it and downloaded the sample chapter on interruptions. While scanning through and reading about internal interruptions, I realized that I was in the middle of one. My simple task - to focus on writing an article, had been interrupted by a stream of internal interruptions that led me to reading about internal interruptions. I have TADD. I'm out of denial, so what's the next step? ;-)
