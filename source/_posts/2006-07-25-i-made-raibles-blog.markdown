Apparently Matt Raible thought my JSF modifications to the AppFuse-Compass tutorial were good enough to merit a mention on his blog: [AppFuse Videos updated for 1.9.3](http://raibledesigns.com/page/rd?entry=appfuse_videos_updated_for_1).  Check out the bottom of the entry.

Compass really is a nice tool - I was able to provide search capabilities for an app I'm working on right now with about 2 days worth of work (having never worked w/ Compass before), and man is it fast! I can't get a search to exceed 1.5 seconds!
