I found [Project Able](http://blogs.opensymphony.com/plightbo/2006/08/project_able_a_complete_java_w.html) while reading [Raible’s blog](http://www.analienandastranger.com/?p=25) this morning. While it doesn’t claim to duplicate everything that AppFuse does (i.e. they pick a framework and stick with it instead of providing choice), they are doing some neat things. I may take a look at it if I ever have time. ![:-)](http://www.analienandastranger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

> Project Able is a full Java-based web development stack designed to make web development painless. In a sense, it is an attempt to bring together quality opensource tools in one cohesive stack, similar to what Rails has done for Ruby, while also encouraging common practices I’ve used in software engineering for a long time.
> 
> It is very similar to projects such as Trails, Grails, and AppFuse. However, there are a few key differences:
> 
>   * The stack components are different (WebWork, Spring, iBatis, etc).
>   * In addition to the basic framework, Able also encourages common development techniques and patterns (more below).
