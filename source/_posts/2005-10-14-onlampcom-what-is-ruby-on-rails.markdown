[What Is Ruby on Rails](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/10/13/what_is_rails.html) by Curt Hibbs -- Ruby on Rails is an impressive web development framework that will soon reach version 1.0. While there's a lot of buzz, it can sometimes be difficult to discern the steak beneath the sizzle. Curt Hibbs walks through the features and pieces of Ruby on Rails to show how it fits together and where its big benefits come from.

I read this article this morning and I have to say it makes me even more impressed with Rails. I think it has the potential to be a BIG player in the web application development space - if not to replace Java, PHP, etc., with Ruby as many developers' platform of choice, it will definitely challenge the existing framework developers for Java, etc., to scale even bigger heights when it comes to features and ease of development.
