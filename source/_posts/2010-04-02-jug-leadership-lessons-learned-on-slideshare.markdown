I've been playing a bit with [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net) today and I took the opportunity to upload the slides from my [Java.net Community Corner interview with Kevin Farnham at JavaOne 2009](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/07/02/how-start-and-grow-jug-community-corner-2009-podcast). SlideShare has a nice feature that allows you to sync up the audio from an MP3 file with your slides, and since both were available, I thought I'd give it a try. The interface is extremely easy to use and I'm very happy with the outcome.

This talk covers the various things I've learned about leading a Java User Group over the past few years. I would say that these are definitely applicable to leading any type of user group, so even if you aren't a Java person, you might find some meat here. Enjoy!
