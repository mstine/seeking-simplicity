I've been wanting to post a picture of my new work setup for awhile, but I wanted to wait until I finished getting setup over at 160 Shadyac Avenue. Just for fun, I thought I'd go VMWare Fusion crazy and boot up every virtual machine I've got - you're actually looking at 7 OS's booted concurrently between two machines. To the left I've got my 15" MacBook Pro (2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM) running Mac OS 10.4, Windows XP, and Ubuntu. To the right I've got my Mac Pro tower (2 x 2 GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon processors, 5 GB 66 MHz DDR2 FB-DIMM RAM) driving the dual 19" Dell LCD's, running Mac OS 10.4, Windows XP, Ubuntu, and Solaris Express. Whew - that was a mouthful. Thanks to Matt Raible for [blogging](http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/re_one_30_monitor_or) about the Griffin Technologies iCurve laptop stand - I picked up its successor, the Elevator, for my MacBook Pro. I've got pictures from my past desktops over the years - I need to dig them up and show the procession of developer technology here. It's been quite a ride from my first system as a junior developer six plus years ago.
