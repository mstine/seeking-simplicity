My apologies to my colleagues down the street at [AutoZone](http://www.autozone.com), but I just had to do that. :-)

I recently accepted the role of Agile Zone Leader at [DZone.com](http://agile.dzone.com). For the past few weeks I've been publishing a couple of articles a week on various agile development topics. I'm very happy to get the extra exposure and I hope that folks are getting some value out of my posts. On the downside, I have virtually zero time to write anything here, but on the upside I'm definitely writing more regularly. Nothing like positive pressure to deliver!

Here are some links to my recent articles:
