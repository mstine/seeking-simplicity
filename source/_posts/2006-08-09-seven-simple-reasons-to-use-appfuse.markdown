I’ve wanted for some time now to write a blog entry promoting my favorite open source project - AppFuse. Since I started developing web applications using AppFuse as a base, I can truly say that I’ve rediscovered the joy of software development. I’ve found no other technology or methodology that has allowed me to place as much focus as I now do on solving business problems and not on technology ramp-up or figuring out the eccentricities of “framework X.” In this article, [Matt Raible](http://raibledesigns.com/), the founder of the [AppFuse](http://www.appfuse.org/) project, humbly states very compelling reasons that you should use AppFuse for your J2EE development. To summarize, here are the 7 reaons:

  1. Testing
  2. Integration
  3. Automation
  4. Security Features and Extensibility
  5. Code Generation with AppGen
  6. Documentation
  7. Community

Read the article to get the meat:
