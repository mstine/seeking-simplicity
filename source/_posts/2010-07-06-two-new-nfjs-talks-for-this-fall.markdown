title: Two new NFJS talks for this fall!

I'm excited to announce that I am working up two brand new talks for this Fall to go along side my regular fare. Both of these talks are already scheduled for shows in Boston, MA and Seattle, WA.

The first talk is entitled "The Seven Wastes of Software Development." We'll begin by examining one of the key tenets of Lean Software Development, that of eliminating waste. We'll then walk through the seven wastes identified by Mary and Tom Poppendieck in their books:




	
  * Partially Done Work

	
  * Extra Processes

	
  * Extra Features

	
  * Task Switching

	
  * Waiting

	
  * Motion

	
  * Defects



We'll examine each of these wastes and look at some of their common manifestations, both in our coding practices and in our development methodologies. We'll also examine strategies for eliminating each of these wastes from our development efforts.  

The second talk is entitled "Yes You Kanban!" Kanban is sweeping through the agile software development space. Is it hype? Or is it a useful tool to add to our belt? In this session, we'll walk through the following topics and I'll let you be the judge:


	
  * What is Kanban?

	
  * What is Kanban NOT?

	
  * Comparison to SCRUM

	
  * Roots of Kanban

	
  * David Anderson's five essential elements/principles of Kanban (Visualize workflow, Limit work-in-progress, Measure & manage flow, Make process policies explicit, Use models to recognize improvement opportunities)

	
  * Examples of Kanban systems



I hope to see some of you in these talks this Fall and I look forward to our discussions!
