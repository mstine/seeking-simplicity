Hi everyone! I'm currently in the process of developing new talks for my Fall 2010 NFJS tour dates. While I don't know yet where I'll be speaking, I can tell you that I've registered availability for the following shows:




	
  * Boston, MA

	
  * Seattle, WA

	
  * Atlanta, GA

	
  * Minneapolis, MN

	
  * Chicago, IL

	
  * Denver, CO



So, if you're in one of those cities and you're thinking about attending NFJS when it comes your way (see [here](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com) for the schedule), I'd like to know what you want to hear about assuming I come your way.

To narrow down the potentials a bit, here are my personal areas of focus:




	
  * Agility/Lean/Kanban

	
  * Native Mobile and Web Mobile Software Development (iPhone/iPad/Android)

	
  * Web Development in General (HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript)

	
  * Modularity and OSGi



If there are any topics from these four areas that you'd like to hear more about, please speak up in the comments section. And even if you're not in one of these cities, most of any talks I develop for the Fall will likely show up on the 2011 tour as well, so please speak up anyway!

Thanks in advance for your feedback!
