I completed an interest survey for a potential Selenium-focused conference several weeks ago, and I'm excited to let you know that the "powers that be" have decided that the conference is going to happen! I have already submitted my "Executable Specifications: Automating Your Requirements Document with Geb and Spock" talk as a potential session. Whether it makes the conference program or not, I plan on attending the event. Here are the details:
