So far one of the greatest things about JavaOne for me has been the opportunity to connect face-to-face with so many people that I've only communicated with digitally. I've also been able to catch up with folks that I've run into through other conferences, the JUG, and work:




	
  * Finally met Aaron Houston and Mark DeHart from [Sun JUG Programs](http://java.sun.com/community/usergroups/index.jsp). These guys have supported the Memphis JUG from the very beginning and have kept us supplied with tons of cool swag, as well as a Sun SPOT that continues to be a hit. Great guys.

	
  * Briefly chatted with [Carol McDonald ](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/caroljmcdonald/)from Sun. She was our very first JUG speaker and also had an extremely stressful encounter with our then new projector.

	
  * Got to catch up with [Keith Donald](http://blog.springsource.com/author/keithd/) of SpringSource on what he's been up to with Spring and what we've been up to with our SRM project. Keith joined us for a week long consulting engagement earlier this year and fit in like another member of the team. He and Oleg Zhurakousky covered the JUG meeting that week as well and we had our largest attendance ever.

	
  * Finally met [Van Riper](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/van_riper/), the man behind JUG-USA.

	
  * Had a great dinner conversation with Abdel Remani, student JUG leader from California State University, Chico.

	
  * Got to catch up with [Dave Booth](http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidgbooth), formerly the JUG program guy from JetBrains, now with GravityGears.

	
  * Briefly chatted with [Wayne Fay](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/wayne-fay/4/326/193), one of our former JUG members now working in San Francisco.



All in all it has been wonderful getting to connect with all of these folks, put faces to names, and share updates. Come to JavaOne. You get to meet neat folks!
