It appears that Ruby on Rails is changing the WORLD of software development - I wasn't aware of just how much influence it was having in the world of other languages. Here Marc Fleury (JBoss CEO) says that it had a huge influence on Seam - JBoss's venture into the Java web framework space. And then the list of RoR clones: Biscuit (PHP), Grails (Java), Monorail (.NET), Turbo Gears (Python), Cake PHP, Subway (Python), Catalyst (Perl).....All I can say is that the RoR guys must have done something right!
