> On July 27, 2007, STJUDE-SRM 1.0 was released.  
  
STJUDE-SRM is a laboratory management system designed to support shared resource facility (or core lab) activities. It was designed and developed by the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  
  
Shared resources supported include DNA synthesis, Peptide synthesis, DNA sequencing, Functional Genomics (spotted microarray laboratory), and Affymetrix (commercial microarrays) laboratories. STJUDE-SRM was also designed so that it is sufficiently modular and scalable to support other laboratory activities as needed. It could conceivably support all facilities on a campus or at a research organization and provide a single portal for investigators to access these resources, retrieve data, receive invoices for services, and generate reports.  
  
Currently available is a build of STJUDE-SRM which is certified for JBoss 4.2.0.GA running on J2SE 5.0. Builds for JBoss 4.0.5.GA and BEA Weblogic Server 8.1 are forthcoming.

This is a VERY satisfying announcement for me, as I have spent the better part of the last six years working on this project. I was so excited when I learned we would be releasing it to the open source community. Enjoy!
